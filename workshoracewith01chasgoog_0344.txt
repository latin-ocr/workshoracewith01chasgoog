om· anns} the babai-lan hath' well-nigh destroyed us' in the midst of ’ 'our
strife, the age is so full of shamcless adultery and lasciviousness. Not from
such parents were born the· conqueror-s of PyrrhuS, AntiochuS, and Hannibal,
the manly offs ring of soldiers who had handled the plough and carried the
fagot. So dodi time spoil all things Our fathers were not as their fathers,
nor we as they3 and our children shall be worse than ourselveS.

1. immeritus] The Ode is addressed, like the otherS, ‘virginibus pueris-
que‚’ and they could not be said to be responsible for the guilt of th'e civil
wars (‘ delicta ') just brought to a elose; but if they failed to do their duty in
restoring the temples‚ and so repairing the consequent-es of the wars, they
must be prepared to reap the fruits of them in the‘displeasure of the gods·
As before mentioned (C. ii. 15, Introduction ‚ Augustus applied himself to
the restoration of the sacred buildingS, and irgil amplifies his iety, sayi‘ng
he erected three hundred shrines to the gods after his triumph) in B. c. 29
(Aen. viii. 714, sqq.). ‘Aedes ’ in this place corresponds with Virgil's ‘ de'-
lubra,' which were mere way-side shrines, each containing an image or an
altar, or both. Tiberius followed up the work that Augustus began (Tac.
Anu. ii. 49): “Iisdem temporibus deum aedes vetustate aut igni abolitas,
coeptasque ab Augusto dedicavit.'’ The temples he built or completed uere
three in number, dedicated to Liber, Libera, and CereS, to Flora, and to J uno.
See C. ii. 15. 20. S. ii. 2. 104. ·

2. [fontaned Horace uses the same form again (S. i. 4 85) ; and Vir-gil
likewise, “ Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento ’² (Aen. vi. 852).
Livy often expresses himself so. · · ’ ·

6. {linc unane, ete] ‘Hine ’ means ‘ from the power of the· gods ' ; ‘ huc,
‘to it.

principium] See note above on C. 4. 41. See Livy (45. 39); “ Major-es
vestri omnium magnarum rerum et principia exorsi ab Dis suntet tinem
statuerunt.”

9. Monaeses el Pacori mamm] Pacorus was son of the Parthian king,
Orodes (Arsaces XIV), and appointed hy his father to command the army
against the Romans· in the place of Surenas, who defeated Crassus Β. c. 53,
and whom Pacorus put to death. He was associated with the renegade La-
bienus, and overran byria and a great part of Asia. Minor, while M. Antonius
was amusing himself with Cleopatra. Monaeses is supposed to be the same
as Surenas, the latter being not a name but a title. Horace alludes‚ erhaps
without strict 'accur-acy, to the» defeat, first of Crassus, and then of Β . Anto-
nius, who was twice defeated, first through his legate, Decidius Saxa, in Β. o.
40, by Pacorus, and four years later, when he commanded in erson, at which
time, however, Pacorus was dead. See Introduction to last de.

10. Noa auspecatonl ‘forbidden by the auspices! This is the usual wa
of accounting for defeat, by laying it to the neglect of the auspices, which
were always taken before a war. ἢ

12. renidet] ForeeIIIni explains this word by ‘gaudere,’ ‘laetari' The
word is not uncommonl used for smiling, and, as it seems to be only another
form of ‘niteo‚’ the lig ting up of the face through pleasureis perhaps the
origin of this derived sense. ·

14. Dacus et Aetke‘ops,] These were auxiliarios in Antonius's army at Ae-
tium, ‘ Aethiops ’ standing for Egvptian. Cleopatra supplied the ficet.

20. In patriam populumfflte} These words¹ are those of a common formula.

vals of Diana. naming-masters were a class of slaves called Pantomimi.

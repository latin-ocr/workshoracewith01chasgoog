SATIRE VI.

the delights of the country, the former as connected with the importunity of ·
people asking for his influcnce with Maecena-5, or for information upon public
affairs of which he knows nothing, though they will not believe it. ι Τ116 sub-

mouse visits the country meuse, and, taunting him with his seclusion‚ tempts
him to accompany him to town, and then entertains him at a rich man's
‘table. But the servants, coming in suddenly at daybrcak, frighten them
both out of their witS‚ and the country mouse goes home again, resolving to
keep to his own quiet hole in the fields, and try the town no more.

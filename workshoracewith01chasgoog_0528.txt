'thyme, Horace applies to himself (C. iv. 2. 27, sqq.). As to ‘orator' and)
‘respondere‚' see S. i. l. 9, n., and on ‘ hederae praemia,' see C. i. 1. 29.

- 23. seu civica jura Respondere] This is a singular expression for the usual
‘jus resspongerefl or >⁴ de jure respondere,' which was said of the jurisconsul-

·tus. ee . 1. . 9.

Δ 26. ‹bl-&ida curarum jbmenta] ‘Fomenta’ here seems to mean honor,
riches, Sne„ by which care is sought to be alleviatcd, but which, after all, are

· but cold remedieS, and 'ineffectuah “fomenta vulnus nil malum levantia‚'’

as Horace says (Epod. 11. 17, where see note).

28. Ῑκινυί properemus etamplz] As to ‘properemus‚' see Epp. 2. 61, 11.,
and with the sentiment compare Epp. l. 25‚‚“Aeque pauperibus prodest,
locu letibus ue. ''

301? si tibi ἔξω] Horace sayS, ‘¹ You must write me back word whether
you make as much of Munatius as he desem’es, or whether your mutual re-
gard, like a wound ill-sewu, refuses to unite, and is torn open again-f' Mu-
natius has been mentioned before (C. i. 7, Introduction) as the son of Muna-
tius Plancus, the consul of Β. c. 42. We know nothing more about him,
‘except that he was consul in A. D. 13, and that he was afterwards seut as one
·of the commissionem from the senate to the mutinous German legions (Tac.
·Ann. i. 39). It appears‘he and Florus had quarrelled3 we are not told what ·
it was about; but Horace attributes it to youthful heat and ignora-nce of the
world. He likens them to unbroke hors-es, and tells them that they ought to
make it up, and that when the come home they will find the fatted calf
ready for sacrifice. Compare -. i. 36, written on the return of Numida. It
is impossible to put the different parts of the sentence together so as to make
the construction regular and natural, but the sense-is clear enough. Horace
frequently uses ‘ dignus ' with the infinitive. See C. iii. 21. 6, n. ‘ Indignus ’
he uses in the same way here, and in A. P. 231, but in the usual prose eon-
struction with· ‘qui’ and the subjunctive in S. ii. 3. 236. By ‘fraternum
foedus' Horace only means that they were or had been, and ought to be,
<⁶¹ paene gemelli Fraternis animiS,'’ as he says btlow, Epp. 10. 3.

Tms Epistle is addressed to Albius Tibullus, the poet, to whom also C.
1.· 33 is written. The letter only professes to be one to inquire after Tibul-
lus3 but occasion is taken to commend his fortunes and himself, and to bid
him live every day as if it were the last. Horace writes to his friend (proba-
bly from Rome).at his place near Pedum, a town of Latium, not far from ·
Praeneste. There Tibullus had a good estate, inherited from his father,
which. before his death, 113 appears by some means to have diminished.
That his losscs must have occurred after this Epistle was written, we may

erhaps infer from v. 7 . He lived chiefly on his estate, in the quiet pursuits

Iorace here supposes him to be engaged in; though immediately after the
battle of Actium he accompanied Messalla into Gaul, and was absent about
a year, which, as far as we know, compi-ised all his active life. Horace,
among other blessings.‚ assigns him good health3 nevcrtheless he died young.
It appears that, while many disparaged Horace's writings‚ Tibullus judged
'them kindly, and the affection the two pocts bore one another cannot be mis-
taken. Tibullus was probably ten or twelve years younger than Horace.
'Tibullus died the same year with virgil (Β. c. 20), or very soon after.

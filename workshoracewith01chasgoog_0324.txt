as ‘rex ' elsewhere (see C. i. 4. 14). ‘Regal piles ' are the enormous villas..
of the rich. ‘Jam' means ‘soon.'

2. undique latius} Cicero (ad Att. i. 18, 19, 20) complains that some of
his contemporaries (‘ piscinarii ’ he calls them) were so devoted to their fisb-
ponds (⁴ stagna ’). that they cared more for them than for all the interests of
the state, as if this might fall and they still keep their playthings: “ Ita sunt
stulti· ut amissa republica piscinas suas fore salvas sperare videantur '' (18).
Elsewhere he calls them ‘piscinarum Tritones’ (ii. 9). As to the ‘lacus
LucrinuS,' see A. P. 63, n.

·5. tum violaria] This is op sed to ‘tum laurea’ (v, 9).

6. Myrtus] This word is o two declensions. So likewise are ‘ quercus‚'
‘lauruS‚’ ‘pinuS,' ‘cornuS,’ ‘ficus’

onmis copia narium] ‘Every abundance of sweet smells.' ‘Narium' is
put for the erfumes of flowerS. It is not so used elsewhere.

10. ictus. ‘Ictus’ is used by other poets besides Horace for the fierce
rays of the sun. · See ovid. Met. v. 389. Lucretius, ii. 808.

11. intonsi!v This is equivalent to ‘antiqui.' ‘Catonis’ is M. Porcius
Cam, called the Censor from the stem way in which he executed the duties ⁰
οξ εὴὲιῑῇοίὶὶοθ, Β. c. 184, doing all he could to put down luxurious and expen-‘
sire a its. A '

12. Auspiciis] ‘Example.’ . ·

13. census] A man’s property was called his ‘census ' because it was.
rated by the censors once in five years; and the period was called a ‘lus-
trum‚' because, when th'is duty was finished‚ the censors performed a. lustra·
tion, or sacrifice of atonement for the city.

. 14. nulla decempedis] ‘ Privatis ' agrees with ‘ decempedis! Horace com-
plains that the private houscs of his day had vcrandahs (⁴ porticus ') so large ·
as to bc measured by a ten-foot rule. Here they dined in the hot weather‚
and caught the cool breezes of the north. This practice was called ‘coenatio ’
ad Boream! ‘ Opacam excipiebat Arcton ’ is like Virgil's ‘Frigus captabis ’

. opa‹·um' (Ec. i. 53), where ‘the shady coolness' means ‘the coolncss

caused by the shade’: and ‘opacam Arcton' combines the notions of the
north-wind and the coolness of ‘the shady side of the house, which was the
north side. ‘Metata' is again used passively in S. ii. 2. 114, but no other
writer so uses the word.

17. Fortuitum caespitem] ‘ The turf that lies at hand,' and so, ‘cheap.’
This means cottages roofed with turf, as Virgil says (Ec. i. 69), “tuguri

congestum culmine caespes.'⁰ ‘ Fortuitum ’ is equivalent to τὸν τυχόντα.
Horace alludes to the ruined state of the temples in C. ii. 18. 2.

ODE XVI.

Tms rson to whom this Ode is addressed, Pompeius Grosphus), is said
to have en of the equestrian order. He was possessed of large, property in
Sicily, of which island he was probably a native. On his return, Horace

ave him a letter of introduction to his friend Iccius (Epp. i. 12), 111 which

e speaks highly of his worth. He is not to be confounded with the Pom-
peius of O. ii. 7 (Introduction). He appears, from the latter part of the Ode, '
to have been in Sicily when it was written. Perhaps he had written Horace
a letter which called up the particular train of thought that runs through the
Ode, or had qualities which made it applicable to him. The object of the
Otgc is to reprove the craving for happiness which has been bestowed 'upon
o ers· · · ·

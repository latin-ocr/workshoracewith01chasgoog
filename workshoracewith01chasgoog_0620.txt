THE PUBLISHERS’ CIRCULAR

“There was great need sor just such a book as this. Whate·
ly’s Logic is too old for the present state os the scie-nce, and the
t work of Min daels more with applied and concrete thought
ἓξὲξ with the abstract laws of pure thou ht. Professor Bowen’s
work is fully u to the modern state os e science. It embodies
the results reae ed by Hamiiton Mansel, 'sbornsom De M urgan,
Boole, Mill, and others», who, within the last quat-ter of a centu ‚
have given a new impetus to the study of the laws of thoug t
and the theory os lo ‘cal forms. The labors of Keiswetter, Fnes,
Bencke‚ Dressler, robisch, and others among the Gennans,
have also been ‘placed under contribution. We have thus a man·
ual for collegiate stud and for the perusal of professional and
eduoeted minds, whic will initiate them into the most recent

THE ROUND TABLE.

‘⁶ There has been in our language an open field and a pressing
demand sor a treatise os the character which Professor Bowen has
sought to provide. We are lad that he has been induced to
meet this demand. We are g ad, also, to find that he has met it
so well. A sim le inspection of the well-conceived and well-
arranged table o contents is sufficient to· convince any one who
is eonversant with the subiect, and with other-treatises that the
author has been very judicious m the selectron os histleadmg
themes and in the general outline of his subordinate divisions.
..... We can confidentl pronounce this work to be scholar-
like and thorough in its c racter, and most honorabie to the
distinguished position and reputation of its respected author. ”

NEw-ENGLANDER.

“The plan of Professor Bowen is more comprehensive than
that os any os the works which we have named. The execution
is in many respects deserving of hi h commendation, as we
should expect it would be from the we -known ability, then-ough-

ness‚ and industry of the author.”

zon’S HERALD.

‘⁸ As it regards definition, cbarness, and suinessps staternent of
the various points which make apomplete· sciennfic treatise‚ we
think the author has succeeded m producing a better text-book

than any other before the American people.”

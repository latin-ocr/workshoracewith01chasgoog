3. Cassi Parmensis opuscula] Parma (Parma) was a. town belonging to
the Boii, at the edge of the Macri Campi, in Cisalpine Gaul, on a river of the
same name, which runs-into the Po about twelve miles north of the town.
The Via AEmilia passed through Parma. Cassius of Parma was one of the
murderers of Julius Caesar‚ and a ‘ tribunus militum ’ in the army of Brutus
and Cassius· He was therefore, in all probability, well known to Horace.
After following the fortunes of Sextus PompeiuS, he joined M. Antonius, on
whose side he fought at the battle of Actium.' After that battle he retired to

⁴ Athens, and. there he was put to death by order of Augustum What the
· ‘ opuscula ³ Horace refers to were, we do not know, but it is clear that he

thought well of them.

4. silens inter reptare salubres] ‘Repto ³ (frequentative of ‘repo’)‚ which
contains the same root as ἕρπ’ω, signifies to saunter, or go about quietly3 and
Lucretius applies it to flocks of sheep grazing on downs (ii. 317). The woods
rare called· ‘ salubre5,’ because· their shade pretet-ts from the h'eat of· the sun,
as Cicero says (Cat. M. c. 16) : “ Ubi enim potest illa aetas (senectus) aut
caleseelrebvel apricatione melius vel igni, aut vicissim umbris aquisve refrige-
rari sa u rius? '

6. Non tu corpus eras sine pectora] ‘ Sine pectore' is used twice by Ovid
(Met. xiii. 290), “rudis ct sine pectore miles.'' Heroid. xvi. 305:

’ “ Hunccine tu speres hominem sine pectore dotes

, ὸΡοεειθ satis formae, Tyndari, nosse tuae ’.ἱ ” ·
It means ‘ intellect,' of which the ,ancients held the heart to be the seat.
There is a difficulty in ‘ cras.' Terence uses ‘ Tune eras ’ἔ ’ for ‘Is it you ’ἓ ’
Th?3 itflom is ιιηΙίῘΞο anything of our own. The imperfect is used irregularly
in . i. 27. 19, an 31. 4.

offendat sordibus.'' .
15. Me pinquem et nitidum] This corresponds to Suetonius’s description
of Horace’s person, ‘⁸ Habitu corporis brevis fuit atque obesus? On ‘ bene
curata cute,' see S. ii. 5. 38. Horace indulges his friend with a joke at his
own expense. He was getting sleek and in good keeping. ⁴

As to Torquatus·‚ the person whom Horace in this Epistle‘ invites to dine
with him, sce C. iv. 7, Introduction.. The occasion was the evening before

= “ warni mmmm· percusti] ⁸ camera? which is fiom the Greek καμάρα, and
is sometimes spelt with nn ‘a‚' was nn archcd ceiling, as ‘ lacunar' was-flat<
The latter was so called from panels with raised sides, and so having each
the appearance of a ‘ lacus ’ or shallow reservoir, into which the eciling was

sometimes divided. It was common in rich housee for the eeiling to be richly·

ornamented. See C. ii. 18. 2. ‘Laqueur’ is another form of ‘ lacuum-‚³
Horace also uses the expression ‘laqueata teeta' (C. ii. 16. 12), which is
found in othei· writem. ··

penes te ea i'l This seems to correspond to the Greek ἐν ἐαυτῷ εἶναι, for a
man in his right mind: or it may mean to ask if the man is ‘suo jure,' which
one ‚who was ⁸ furiosu's ' would not be. ν

274. cum balba soria] ⁴ Yon strike your lisping words against your old
palate‚’ which means that he talks in a silly, childish way.

275. Adde cruorem Stultitiae] But childish nonsense is not the worst of
this madneee. Add bloodshed to folly nnd run into the most violent excesscs
of passion, and you will not di) mone than such lusts commonly lead to.
Such'is the Stoic's meaning. ‘Ignem gladio scrutare’ is a translation of a
Greek sayfflg, πῦρ μαχαίρᾳ σκαλεύειν, ‘ to stir the fire with the swordss which
’ is attributed to Pythagoran. To stir the fire of lust with the swerd, is to stit
up strife and bloodshed in the indulgence of your Iuste.

“ 276. Modo, inqmm, Hellade pere-mea] ‘ To take a late instance,' seems to
be the meaning of ‘mod0.' The story here referred to was probably well
known nt the time, bnt of the actors in it we know nothing. . .

278. Corritusfw't, an conemotae] ‘ Cerritus ' means ‘ mad,' but its derivi’ation.
is uncertain. ‘ Commotus’ is used for different degrees of mental excite-
ment. See v. 209, where the.meaning is the same ns here. Agrippina, who'
was of a hasty temper, is⁴ called ‘ commotior ' by Tacitus (Ann. i. 33). ‘ Cog-
nata. voeabula ' means words which may differ in sound, but are one in
sense. Δ

281. Liber-tinus erat‚] The next folly noticed is superstition. Stertinius
tells, by way of illustration, a story of an old ‘libertinus‚' who went from
. shrine to shrine eret-ted in the ‘ compita.ss spots where two or more streete met,
praying to the Lares Compitales (for whom altars were built in such laeae,
aee above, v: 26, n.) that they would 'grant him immortality. - This ie did
early iq the morning, quite sober, and with hands washed‚ as became ascri-2
ons worshipper. Now this man was sound in·hearing and sight3 but, says

Stertinius, ir his former master had ever wanted to part with him, in putting' .

him up for sale he would have cautioned purchasers that he was not in his
right mind, 3unless he wanted to get into an action to rescind the bargain on
the ground of fraud. It was necessary for a person ·seuing a slave to inform:
the buyer of any bodily or mental defect in him. To wash the hands and
feet before offering prayer or sacrifice was a eustom with the Greeks and
Romans. Hector says (Il. vi. 266):
-· Ξίερσὶ δ’ ‹iulus-mmmm? λείβειν αἴθοπα οἶνον
Α ο ι.

283. surpite] Βὲθμιθαυί. 36. 8.
· 287. in pente Mami] of Menenius nothing is known. ‘Meneniae stul-
titiae' or ‘ineptiae ' is spoken of as a proverb.

289. aduncis, See note on S. i. 9. 18. ‘Illo die’ may mean ‘die ἔθνὴ]-
The Jews fuste on Thursdays and Mondays (“I fast twice in the week,’'

Luke xviii. 12), in commotum-anon, itis said, of the ascent of Moses into the ’
Mount on the fifth day of the week‚ and of his return on the second. The ·

Hac-,tices of the Jews were the best illustr-atinus of superstition in the eyes of
orave and men of the world, and their fast is here perhaps alluded to. See·
note on S. i. 9. 69. On special occasions fests w'ere ordered at Rome. The

vow made by the mother for her siek child is, that, if he recovers, he shall·

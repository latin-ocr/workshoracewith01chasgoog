272 Horas, ,

- commonly used by Herodotus. Horace seems to have been the first Latin
writer who employed it. — Horace says quarrelling is vastly unsuited to those
jovial meetings which are kept up to a late hour, —f vino et lucernis? The
Romans sat down to table seldom later than three or four o'clock, aud com-
monly continued there till past midnight.

6. Immane quantum] This form is imitated from the Greek ε οὗράνιον
ὅσον, θαυμαστὸν ὅσον, ἀμύθητον ὅσον, θαυμαστὰ ἡλίκα, ἀμήχανον ὅσον, -—-
phrases commonly met with in the Greek writers. The same expression
occurs in Tacitus and Sallust, and ‘mirum qnantum,’ ‘nimium quantum,'
are used by Cicero, and Livy (ii. l, fiir). The indicative mood is right,
‘immane qnantum ' being merely an expletive.

8. cubito— presso] ‘ with elbow rested ' on the cushion of the conch.

10. Opuntiae} The birthplace of Megilla (the Locrian Opus) is added, aa
Buttmann remarks, only “ to give the poem a fresher look of individuality.''
The same remark will apply in other instanceS‚ as, ‘⁶ Xanthia Phoceu‚” C.
ii. 4. 2.

13. Cessat zelantas 9] ‘ Are you reluctant ’ to confess ’.ἱ The young man
is shy, and will not tell at first3 when he doce, Horace is supposed to break
out with ‘ Ah miser,' etc.

19. laborabas] Orelli may be right in saying the imperfect refers to the
time when the question was put. But 1 am not sure that some finer sense
of the imperfect tense is not to be traced in this word, as in “ Tempus erat
dapibuS‚ sodales '² (C. i. 37. 4, where see note).

Charyfflid This whirlpool, which still exists near Messina‚ was the terror

of ancient navigator-S. Itis taken here to represent the dangerous position
of the vouth, through his love for some famous beauty and coquette.
21. hesselis] The Thessalians were famous for witehcraft. See Epod.
γ’ ἕῗ. Peyasus expediet Chimaer-m] Bellerophon, bein5¹¹ ordered by the king-
of Lycia to desti-oy the monster Chimaera, is said to ave done so with the
help of the winged horse Pegasus. This part of the story is later than Homer
(see 11. vi. 179, sqq.). Chimaera was a mountain in Lycia, from which flames
were always issuing. The spot has been identified, and this phenomenon is
still visible. ,The ancients described it, from some fanciful conception, as a
female monster, with the head of a lion, the waist of a goat, and the tail of a
serpent. (See Aen. vi. 288.)

ODE XXVIII. ι

Ser-runos, one of Horace's most intimate friendS, had a villa at' Taren-
tum (O. ii. 6), where it is likely Horace on some occasion, if not often, aid
him a visit. ¹ He may have seen a body cast on shore at that place, w ore
the scene of this Ode appears to be laid. The spirit of a shi wrecked man
is introduced, moralizing upon death and asking for burial. ’s reflections
take the form, in the first instance, of an addi-ess to ArchytaS‚ the philoso-
pher, whose name was associated with the lace3 and he· joins w1th him
other worthies‚ whose wisdom and greatness iad not saved them from.the
common lot of all. Thon, seeing a seafaring man passing by, he calls upon
him to cast dust upon his unburied body, in order that he may have rest.

Amnum-r. — Even thee, thou measurer of earth and sea, thou counter οἳ
the sands, Archytas, how small a portion of earth contains thee now! It
profits thee not to have searched the air and traversed the heavens‚ since thou
wert to die. So Tantalus, Tithonus, and Minos have died, and Pythagoras ,

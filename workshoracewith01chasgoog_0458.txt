SATIRE ·v1'11‘. *ἐξ

 

ῦπ the casside of the city walls, in frent οἷ’ Mons Esquilinus, lay the‘
Campus Esquilinae, in which was a public burim-ground for the . rest ol
the eople, and the Sestertium or place of execution for slaves an others ot?
the ower sort, whose bodies were left anburied, for the dog-s and vultures to*
prey irpon (see Epod. Υ. 100). This place, which must always have been a
publio nuisance and a source of malm-la, was ‘given (as some say) by a decre&
of the senam to MoecenaS, ot clse purchased by him, cleared, drained, and
laid out in gat-dene, in which he afterwanls built a handsome house. (Sec 0.·
Ῑὶὶ. 29. Epod. ix. 3. S. ii. 3. 309.) Hie example was afterwards followed
by a member of the house of Lamia, in whose gardens Caligula was buried.
(Suet. Calig. c. 59.) The following Satire was suggested by a figure of
Priapus sel: usp in· Maecenas’s garden. The god ls represented as conti-asting-
the present state of the ground with what is once wne, by which a eompllmemf
is convcyed to Maecenas for his public spii-it in ridding the city of such a
nuisancc. Priapus is eleo⁴ made to complain of the trouble hc hac, in keep-³

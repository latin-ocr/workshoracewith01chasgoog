tention to murder her children and her rival, aad reckons upon their seerecy

202. mia non ut nunc orichalco vineta] The ‘tibia' was an instrument
originallv made of a hollow recd (Pliny, xvi. 36. 66), or a boxwood pipe
(ovid, Fast. vi. 697), or the ahin-‘bone of some animal, from which the name
is derived. Afterwards it was brought to greater per-fection, and was made
of ivory sometimes. It resembled the flageolct or clarionet. It was usual to
play two ‘ tibiae ' together, as observed on C. i. 1. 32, where see note. These
111 the British Museum have six heles. Probably in the days of Horace they
had more. The metal which the ancients called ‘orichalcum’ is unknown.
It was not to be found even in Pliny's time. The probable derivation is from

ὅρος and χαλκός, the meaning being ‘ mountain-bronze.’ With this the parts
of the ‘tibia,’ which took to pieces as our flutes do, were bound at the join-
ings. orace says that in simpler days the ‘ tibia ' s'erved for an aceompani-
ment to e chorae, but afterwards it came to drown it. In those days the
population of the ci was smaller‚ the theatres less crowded. and the audi·
enee more reverentia and attentive. What times Horace alludes to, it is diffi-
cult to say. Orelli thinks his history of choral music is a fanciful account,
fluctuating wonder-fully between the practice of the Greeks, that of the Ro-
mans, and that which his own imagination has drawn; and this is perhaps

· the case.

. 208. Postquam coepit cyrus] That is, “post Punica bella” (see Epp. ii. 1.
162, 11.) if we take the Romane, and the Persian war if we suppose the
Greeks to be meant (See v. 93 of the same Epistle.) As to ‘placari Ge-
1111153 see Epp. ii. 1. 144, and i. 7. 94,,11.

, 211. numerumque modisque] This combination occurs abore, Epp. ii. 2. 144.
‘ Liber laborum ' is a poetical construction like “operum solutis '’ (C. iii. 17 .
16) and “opernm vacuo ” (S. ii. 2. 119).

, 215. traxitque voque per pul-pita vestem ς] Τ110 ‘palla' worn by tragic
actors had a train called ‘ syr1na‚' from σύρειν, because it swept the stage.
This is what Horace alludcs to. The Roman dress was probably not so
splendid as the Greek. As to ‘pulpita,' see E p. ii. l. 174.

- 216. Sic etiam fidibus voces crevere semea] ee above, v. 83, 11. The se-
date and serious Dorio style would bc expresscd by ‘ fidibus severis ’ 3 but
” Horace is speaking generall , and probably from his own imagination, when'

he says that in the course oiy time the grave style of music to which the 0110-“
ruses were once sung gave way to a more vehement style, as the eloquence
of the chorus grew more impetuouS, and it be an to speak in languagze
obscure, prophetie, and oracular. There is 'no istorica accuracy in this
account, though in respect to the obscurity of some of the Greek choruses

Horace wrote from what hc knew of them.

220. Carmine qui trayz‘co] Horace here passes on to the Satyric Drama
of the Greeks. A goat was the prize contended for in the composition of the

choral songa or dithyrambs to which the name τ· ῳδία first belonged.
The name may have been⁶ derived from the prize. ( ee'beloW, v. 275, 11.)
The chorus appeared in the character of Satyrs as attendants on Dionysus,
at whose festival they performed. Their subjects were originally confincd'to
the adventurm, serious and sportive, of that god, and therefore were a mix-
ture of mirth and gravity. Choerilus, an older contemporary of AEschylus,
seems to have laid the foundation of an independent Satyric Drama, the
entire separation of which from tragedy, as we now understand the word,
was effected a few years later by Pratinas of Phlius in Argolis, about Β. c.
500: thencefonwvard it was usual for the tragic poets to exhibit four plays at
a time (tetralogies), of which the fourth was a Satyric Drama, such as the
Cyclops of Euripides.

- 224. patus et exlex] This expresses the frecdom Which attended the
Dionysiae festivals after the sacrifices were over. -. ’

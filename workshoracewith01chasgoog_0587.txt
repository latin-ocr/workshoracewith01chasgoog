120. Scriptor houm-atum sisorte reponis] ‘ Honoratus ' is only an ornamen-
tal epithet, corresponding to Homer's κλυτός, etc. ‘ Reponis ' means ‘'put
upon the stage again! The word is -used in a different sense, v. 190: '‘Fa-
bula, quae posci vult et spectata reponi.'' “

122. nihil raon arr-oyet arnoia] ‘ Let him claim everything for arms‚’ that ie,
let him make arms his one appeal.

123. flebilis Ino,] There are several fragments remaining of a play by
Euripides bearing the name of Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, and wife of
Athamas, who threw herself into the sea with her son Melicerta, and went
through various sorrows through the wrath of Here, and the rivali-y of her
husband's other wives, Nephele and Themisto. She was worshipped after
her death as Leucothea, or Matuta Mater.

124. Perfidus Ixion, Io vaya,] AEschylus, SophocleS, and Euripides each
wrote a tragedy entitled ‘ Ixi0n‚' of which fragments remain. See C. iii. 11.
21. The wanderings of Io, the daughter of Inachus, king of ArgoS, in the,
form of a cow (whose passage across the strait that separates the Propontis
from the Euxine· gave it the name of Bosporus), are related in many wayS.
The most remarkable passage on this subject is contained in the Prometheus
of AEsch luS, in a scene in which she is herself introduced.

128. afficite est proprie communia diceret] ‘ Communia’ means here what

everybody knowS, or what is common property, as opposed to fictions of one's
own creating, and ‘ proprie dicere ² is to tell it so as to make it one’s own.
· 131. Publica materies privati juris erit] ‘Public materiale will become
private property.’ Horace uses (without strict accuracy) terms which have
distinct legal significations. ‘Proprie communia dicere‚’ above, is the same
as making that which is ‘ publica materies ' ‘ privati juris! ‘ Communia’ is
usual in the sense of partnership property, andis different from ‘publica'3
but here they have the same meaning. Horace seems to have followed a
Greek proverb, χαλεπὸν τὰ κοινὰ ἶδιῶσαι. As to ‘deducisf see S. i. 10.

132. vilem patulumque moraberis orbent,] ‘ If you linger not about the vulgar
and wide round.' What Horace means, is the hackneyed round. of subjecte,
phrases, and illustrations, ground which anybody may tread‚ and many have
trod already. ‘Patulus' is opposed to ‘arctus' (v. 133); the latter means
difficult, narrow ground, in which it is not easy to move except b treading pre-
cisely in the steps of him whom you are following, ‘out of w ich diffidcnce
o'r the plan of the work forbids you to advance‚’ that ie, hampers your stem,

and preventa you from showin any originality.
136. ut sev-iptor- cyclicus olim : A class of Epic poets arose some time after

Homer, who, perhaps from the habit of reciting as rhapsodists the Iliad and
Odyssey, were led to adopting subjects akin to Homer’s, and connecting their
poems with his; and their design appear-ing to have been to form their poems
and Homer's into one cycle, embraciug the whole history of the Trojan times,
they came to be called by the grammarians Cyclic poets. Of these the oldest
was Arctinus of Miletus, whose poem was a continuation of the Iliad, and
nearly as long. One of them, Lesches, a Lesbian contemporary with Archi·
lochuS, wrote a poem known as the Μικρὰ Ἰλιάς. It opencd with these two

linea, which Horace may or may not have had in mind:
Ἴλιον ἀείδω καὶ Δαρδανίην εὔπωλον,
ἧς πέρι πολλὰ πάθον Δαναοὶ θεράποντες Ἀρηος.

139. Parem-ime montes] ‘Parturio ' has the same relation to ‘pario ' that
‘ esurio ' has to ‘ed0,' meaning the effert or desire to bring forth, the being in
labor. Porphyrion quotes the proverb on which this and the fable that Phte-

too, with all his learning, hath gone down once more to the grave. But so
it is: all must die alike ; some 10 make sport for Mars, some swallowed up
in the deep: old and young go crowding to the grave : none escape ε Ι, 100,
&ave perished in the waters. But grudge me not, thou mariner, a handful
of earth: so may the storm spend itself on the woodS‚ while thou art safe,
and thy merehandise increases. Is it a small matter with thee to bring ruin
on thy children ’.ἱ Yea, perhaps retribution awaits th 'sels : my curses will
be heanl, and then no atonement shall deliver thee. ' is but the work of a
moment, — thrice cast earth upon me, and hasten on.

1. Te maris et ten-ae] ‘ Te ’ is emphatic, ‘ even thee,’ as the abruptness of
the opening requires, cingor ξιεϊρεῖν.2 κύματα μετρεῖν, were proverbial ex·
pressioris for lost labor. boe beorg. 11. 104, sqq. : —

“ Neque enim numero comprendere refert 3

Quem qui scire velit, Lib ci velit aequoris idem
Dicere quam multae Zep yro turbentur arenae.”

Archimedes wrote a work, ὁ ψαμμίτης, 111 which he computed the grains of
saud on the shores of Sicily, and it may be alluded 1ο here. There is no
reason to sup se that Archytas ever attempted to solve any such problem.

2. Archyta, Archytas was a. native of Tarentum, born towards the end
of the fifth century B. c. He was for a long time the leading man in that

’ this passage, that there was a legend to the effect that Archytas was buried
on the shoreunder the· promonotory of Matinum, running outfrom the range
called Mons Garganus, in Apulia. Possibly, a tomb was shown there as his.
That Archytas was shipwrecked on a voyage down the Adriatic, (which is
the general opinion,) cannot be roved from this Ode.-

10. Panthoiden] The story 11111111οῗ10 is that of Pythagoras, who, to prove
his doctrine of metempsychosi3‚ declared that he had been Euphorbus} the son
of PantheuS, who fell in the Trojan war. In support of which he claimed as
his own a shield hung up in the temple of June at ArgOS, which, when taken
down, proved to have the name of Euphorbus engraved on it.

ll. quamvis] “ Tacitus and the later writers use ⁸ quamvis ' with an indic-
, ative, and, vice versa, ‘ quanquam ’ with a subjunctive.'' (Key's Gram. 1227,
b. note.) The prose-writers of Horace's time would not use ‘ quamvis ’ with
an indicative3 and he uses the subjunctive where the caseis strictly hypo·
thetical, as C. iv. 2. 39, or where it suits the metre, as C. iv. 6. 7.

quamvis clipeo] ⁴ although, by takin down the shield, and testifving to the
season of the Trojan war, he proved gat he had surrendered nothing but his
sinews and his skm to death!

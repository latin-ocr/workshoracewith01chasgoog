25. repensus] This word is not used in this sense of ‘ redeemed ’ elsewhere.
On ‘ seilicet‚’ see C. ii. 14. 9.

26. quitio additis Damnum .·] Horace says, ‘Ye are adding mischief to
disgraee '3 and from what follows it would seem that the mischief would
arise from having among rheni again those who had sunk so low. The dis-
grace had already been incurred‚ in the surrender of the Roman troops.

30. reponi deterioribus] This has sometimes been translated as if Hora
meant that true virtue would not suffer itself to be replaced by false, or virtu
of a lower sort. I rather think he means that true virtue, when it has once
been lost, does not care to be restored to the degencrate. Horace does not
seem to consider that he is making Regulus speak bitter things against him-
“ self. Τὶιθ argument of Regulus is not worth much, and is an invention of
Horaee'S. There is an opposite statement in virgil (Aen. ii. 367) :—

“ Quondam etiam victis redit in praecordia virtus.'' .

in their relation to their ·‘ clientes ’ were called ‘ patroni? See C. iii. 1. 10, n.

ODE VI.

As the former Odes are addressed more to qualities of young men, this
refers more especially to the vices of young women, and so Horace discharges
the promise with whlch this series of Odes begins. Tho state of female mor-
als at the time Horace wrote was probably not so bad as it became shortly
afterwards, though his picture is dark enough. “

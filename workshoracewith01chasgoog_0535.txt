ἐι-γζ of these twenty-siat, ten appear to have been swallowed up by the eon-
quests of Porsenna (see Epod. 16. 4), and of the remaining sixteen the Fabia
was one. The number was graduall increased from sixteen to thirty-one3
but it was not till B. c. 243, towards t e end of the first Punic War, that the
Quirina and Velina were added, being composed of persons belonging to
Cures and Velinus in the Sabine territory. (Liv. Epit. xxx.) These were the
last tribes that were formed.

53. liic ⁸fascea dabit] On the ‘fasces ’ and curule chair‚ see S. i. 6. 97.
‘ Importunas ' means ‘obstinate' or ‘ill-natured'3 ‘facetat-1) ‘polita’
⁵ 56. lucet, eamus Quo ducit 'qula ,·] ‘ The day has dawned, let us be off and
lay in our supplies ; let us hunt and fish, as Gargilius hunted when he bought
a boat-‚- and revended he had caught it himself '; that is to say, let us go to
market. ho is meant by Gargilius», we have no means of knowing. 'she
name is Roman. It occurs in inscriptions, Ile wanted to establish his repu-
tation as a huntsman: got up before flaybreak and returned to the city before
the morning was over, and passed through the Forum while it was full of
people‚ with ποτε, spears, and men, and a mule carrying a boar, which he had
,not cau ht, but purchased.
¹ 58. payns, venabula] As to ‘plagae,' see C. i. l. 28, n. They were too
large to be 'carried by men, aad were laden on mules. (See Epp. 18. 46.)

They were sometimes of enormous extent, as stated in Epod. ii. 32. The
‘venabulum' was a long hunting-spear, with a barbcd point. virgil (Aen.
iv. 131), deseribipgztlre hunting-partylof AEneas and Dido, says ι

,They were used, not for throwing, but thrusting.

⁵ 61. Crudi tumidique lavemur‚] It would seem that some gluttons, with the
idea of ‘renewing their appetite, went to bathe immediately after dinner‚ as
well as (which was the general practice) immediately before. Sudden death
was sometimes the effect of this follv. See Juvenal i. 1-42.

ἵ 62. Caerite cera D12qni,] Coere (Cervetri) was a very ancient town of Etru-
ria, about twenty-seven miles north of Rome. About Β. c. 354, the pcople
of Tarquinii having taken up arms against the RomanS, the Caeritcs were
aeeused of aiding them, and were threatened with punishment; but having
’ asked ardon, they obtained it at the expense of half their territory. They
were a so granted the Roman franchise, without the ‘ suffragium ’ or right of
voting for magistrates. ‘ Caeritum eerae,' or ‘ tabulae,' would mean properly
a regisver of the inhabitants of Caere, who would be registercd when they
came into the above relation to Rome. But it seems probable that, at this
time, the name applied to the registers of all those who were in the position
of ‘aerarii,' that ie, of the citizens of such towns as had not the perfect fran-
chise,·and of those citizens who had for an cause been degraded from their
tribesl Thus Horace means, that they w zo took such a low view of life
wffre not worthy of being Roman citizcnS, being more on an equality with the
crew of Ulysses‚ whom Circe turned to swine (Epp. 2. 23, n.)‚ and who slew
and ate the kine sacred to the Suu, though they swore they would not, and
their return home depended on their onth being ke t.. See,Odyss. xi. 105,
sqq.; xii. 303, sq ; 340, sqq. ‘ Remigium ' is used or the rowch‚ as ‘man-
clilpiumss ⁴ servitium,’ are used for a slave, and many other words are used in
t e same wa . , ·

65. Si, Miymnermus uti censen] Horace was familiar, we may be sure, with
the writings of Mimnermu3‚ the elegiae poet of Smyrna. He preferred him
to Callimachus, as appears from Epp. ii. 2. 99, sqq. His poetr'y is of a mel-
ancholy east, as far as we ean judge from the few fingments that have come
down to us: though love was their principal theme and the onl remedy he
recognizes for the ills of life, it does not seem as if he was very happy iu his

93. Noemos- mperes] This munt be taken to signify tho fovet-ish heats

95. obscuri] ‘ Reserved.’ .

100⁵. Virtutem doctrina pamm] whether virtue is a, scimea (ἐπιστήμη) ·

and capable of being taught (διδακτή), was discussed by Socrates, who held
that it was so, in a certain senso. The question was a common· rhetorical
theme in Horace's day.

105. Qnem llemdnla bibam There is a village called Bardela, which prob-
obl stands on tho site of Mandela. ,From its position et the head of the
val ey, and the winde that blow upon it from'the northeast, it was eolder
than Horace’s residence, higher up the valley‚ which accounts for the de·
seription ‘ mgosus frigore pagus’ us compared with ‘mporiem laudes ' in
Epp. 16. 8. The expression may be suggested by pit-tures and other repie-
oentations of Hiemte, who is exhibiecd as a wrinklod old man, as Ovid de·-
scribes him, apparently from a picture also: “ Indo senilis Hiems tremulo

EPISTLE‘ XIX.

1⁴1 would appear 111111 Horace had imitatem among thosewho abnsed'liimg
and if we aro to understand him to mean what he says, thom were those who
took his convivial odos literally, and, coupling them with the example of tho

⁰ old Greek poem, conceived that tho way to write verses was to propitiato

Bacchus and drink a great deal of wine. Or else he means that they took
to writing in the same ntroin, all about wine and driving· dull caro away, and
so forth, which at second hand would be very poor staff. Such ‘servile im·
itators he speaks of with great disgust; and, while he exposes their shallow·
nese, he accounts for their malevolenee towards himself b the fact of his not
h'aving sought their company οι· hired their applause. e· 111 the same timo
elaims to have been the first to dress the lyric mensures in the Latin longuago,
while he defends himself for having adopted the metros of another, by point-
ing to the examplos of Sappho ancl Alcaeus, -and takes crodit for having
avoided the virulence of Arc iilochuS, while lie imita'ted his verse. This is .
introduced by the way, the chief pul-pose of the Epistln being to show tho
folly of his calumniators and the causo of their abnue.

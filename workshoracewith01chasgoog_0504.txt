12. amico Hercule I] Though Hercules was especially a Grecian hero, and

19. Libitinae quaestus acerbae] The goddess Libitina was' one of the old-
est Roman divinities. She presidcd over funerals and all things pertaining
to the dead. There were kept in her temple all manner of things required
'at funerals, where tho undertakers (hence called Libitinarii) might purchase
or hire them. Also a. register of funcrals was kept in the temple, and when
they were registered a fec was paid. From both the above sources the tem-
'ple would derive increased revenues in a season of greatlmortality. Horace
twice uses the name of Libitina as equivalent to Mors. See C. iii. 30. 6, and
Epp. ii. 1. 493 and Juvenal does the same (S. iv. 122) : “ Nam si Libitinam
evaserit aeger Delebit TabulaS.'' ,

every mouth, as well as of his own (January), and prayer in the morning of
every day. Hence he is called ‘Matutinus pater’; and hence 116 is eon·
founded with the Suu. ‘ Pater ' was the title by which he was commonly
addressed, and the two words were sometimes joined thus: ‘ Januspater.'
See Epp. i. 1623 59.- He was worshipped before the other gods, because he
was the medium through whom men got access to the others (Ovid, Fast. i.
171). ‘Jane ’ is put in the vocative ease by a sort of attraction. (860 C. ii.

“Ae sny course of instruction in the Philosophy of Mind et the present day
must be very imperfect which does not eomprise a. tolerably full view of Hemilton's
metaphysica, Ι heve endeavored, in the present volume, ω prepare e text-book
whioh should eentum, in his own languege, the substance ef all thet he hae written
upon the subject. For this purpose, the ‘ Lectures on Metephyeles' have been
taken ns the basis of the werlu end Ι heve freely abridged them by striking out
the repetitions end redundaneies in which they abeund, end omitting eleo, in great
part, the lond of citatione end references that they contem, ee these are or inferior
interest except to a student of the history or philosophy, or es merke ot the stu-

1⁷oe Rev. Dr. Walker, late President of Har-eard Univmity, in e note to the
editor, says of the book z “Having examined it with some eure, Ι cannot retrein ·
stom congratulating you on the sueoess of the undertaking. You have given the
Metephysies of Sir william Hamilton in his own words, end yet in a form admire-
bly adopted to the recitation—room, end eleo to private students.”

“ The editor hes left scarcely anyphing to be desired. The work presente in short
oompaes the Philosophy οἵ Sir W. Hammon, in his own lengum, more completely

and satisfactorily then many studente would find it done by tho author himself in
the whole serles of his voluminous end seattered productione?

From the North American Review.

‘⁴ Mr- Boven’s eminente es e scholar, thinker‚ and writer in this department, his
large experienoe es a toacher, end his experimental use ot the ⁶ Lecturee ' as a text-
book, might have given the eswranoe, which he has fuuy verlfled, thet so delicate
an editorlel teek would be thoroughly, saturnum end euoeeseruny performed. We
cannot doubt thetis Sir Wiuiem were still living, the volume would heve his eor·
dial imprimatur,· eud the studente of our college· ere to be eongmtuleted thet the
lebors of the great mester of Metephysieel seleuce ere now rendered much more
evellius for their beneflt, then they were mede, perhaps then they could heve been
mede, by his own hmd.‘’

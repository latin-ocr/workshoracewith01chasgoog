S'ATIR‘E'IV. ζ’

'I'ms 'Satire is an essay on good living,‘put in the form· of precepts deliv-
ered to Horace at ⁶second hand by one Catius, who professes to have received
them· from some sage more learned in the art, whom he does not name.
Horace meets-him accidentally, as he is hu ing away from the Professor's
lecture, to think over what he had learnt, 3310 store it in his mind. Catius
recites what he has heard, from memory or from notes, and enters without
preface upon the question of the first course. The Professor may be sup-
posed to have 'carried his hearers through an entire dinncr, “ ab ovo. usque ’
ad mala f’‚(s‚ee S. i. 3. 6, τι). Catius only gives the heads -ofthe lecture and
one or two of the‘ sage's reflectione. *The precepta he delivers inflame Hor-
‘ace with a desire·to see and hear the great man himself, and he prays Catius
to introduce him. It ma be that Horace had some< thir-51 person in his eye,
but we have no means of nowing who it was. If it be· so, there were those;
ho‘doubt, who would understand the allusion at the time. As to the man
Catius himself, he„ appears to have been a well-known follower of the Epicu?
rean school, hut he must have been dead many years before this Satire was
written. Probably, therefore, Horace only introduces his name as a handle
for ridiculing‘ the Epicureans.

not clear. He puts any nonsense, it appears, into the man’s mouth. .‘Po-
nere ’ is to put upon the table, as ‘ posito pavone ’ (S. ii.= 2. 23). The notion

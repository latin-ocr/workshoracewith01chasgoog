Μὲῗ. Pastorem saltaret] That he should dance the Cyclops'· danee, in which·

ο . the uncouth gestures of Polyphemus courting Galatea were represented.

See Epp. ii. 2. 125. Ovid (Trist. ii. 519)·uses ‘salto' in the passive voice:
· “ Et mea sunt populo saltata poemata saepe‘.''
64. larva] The Greek actm-s always wore masks on the stage suited to

. the character they wenc performing. , The Romans adopted them about B. c.

100. They were ωΗοιΙπροσ-αητα by the Greeks, and ⁴ personae ’ or ‘ larvae '
by the Romans. Aa to · cothurnuS‚' see C. ii. 1. 12, n.

65. Dona-sset⁴ T mne catenam] See Epp. i. 1.'4, n. · ,

67. Nihilo dgr-ias] ‘Nihilo’ is to be pronounced as a dissyllable, like
“vehemenmt liquidus '' (Epp. ii. 2. 120).

68. una Farris libra] The allowance of ‘far’ to each slave was four or
five ‘ modii ' by the mouth, and it was served out to them monthly, or some-
times daily (Epp. i. 14. 40). That allowance would ive three pints a da ,
which Messius considers would be three times as mue as Sarmentes eouffi
possibly ‚require; so he „could not better himself by running away. The
‘far’ was otherwise called ‘adoreum’ (C. iv. 4. 41, n.)‚ and seems to have

been the same as the Greek ζειά or ὅλυρα. The nature of this giain is not
exactly known. That two persons above the condition of slaves should be
found in ⁸waiting on any man, great or otherwise, for the purpose of enter-
taiuiug him with such low buffoonery as the above, seems surprising to us;
but we know that there was no personal degradation to which this class of
people, called ‘ parasites' ( diuers out), would not demean themselves for the
pleasure of a good dinner and the company of the great. The entertainment
of these persons would serve io keep the conversation from turning upon
politice, which, as the deputies from both sides were now together, it was
dcsirable to avoid. ” · ·

71. Beneventum] The Appia Via took a northeast turn from Caudium,
for ten miles, till it came to Beneventum (Benevento), a very ancient town,
by tradition said to have been founded by Diomed, and the name of which
was originally, when the Sanmites had it, Maleventum, or some name that
sounded so like Maleventum to a Latin ear that the Romans thought fit to
change it (for good luck) to Beneventum. Thither 'the party proceeded next
day, and put up at an inn, when the host nearly set fire to his house through '
carelessness in roastiug some indifferent thrushes for their dinner. ‘ Hospes

78. quos torret Atabulus]- This was a cold wind, said to be peculial· to
Apulia. ⁴ Torret' is a word which applies to the effect of cohi, as well as
heat. ‘ Atabulus ’ is generally looked upon by the commentatore as the
Sirocoe, a hot land wind. But it came directly off the sea from the east,
and Plin speaks of it as a winter wind.

79. Nffnquam crememus] This is one of the many abbreviated forms Hor·
ace uses. See c.i 36. 8, n., and to the examples there given add the present,
and also ‘surrexe‚' ‘divisse‚’ ‘evasti.' ‘Vixet‚' in Aen. xi. 118, is a like
conti-action of the same tense as ‘erepsemus.’ Horace says that they would·
never have got out of these hills (the range that borders Samnium and sep- ·,
arates it from Apulia) had they not found an inn at the town of Trivicum
(Trevico), at which they were able to put up for the night. He means that
the next stage, which was twenty-four miles farther on, would have been too
long a journey. Horace had been familiar with these mountains in his early
childhood, for they overlooked his native town. ‘ Notos ' refers to these

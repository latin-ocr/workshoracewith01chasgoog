15. laevus vetet ire picus] The woodpecker was a bird of ill-omen. There
was some. confusion among the Romans as to the right hand and left. in
augury, as to which was the propitious side. The confusion may have arisen
from the different practice of the Greeks and Romans in taking note of birds,
the former facing the north and the latter the south, as is commonly sup-
posed. But what is confusion to us, was none to a Roman. (C. 26. 5.)

37. Unde quo vem· 91 This implieS, not that she was so distracted that

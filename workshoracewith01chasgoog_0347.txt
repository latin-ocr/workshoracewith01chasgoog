ODE VIII..

Tms Ode vwas composed on the anniversary of Horaee's accident with the
tree (C. ii. 13). It is addressed to Maecenas, whom he invites to join him in
celebrating the day, which was the lst of Mar'ch, Β. c. 25, or thereabouts.

Axuenna-r. — Wonderest thou, learned friend, what this sacrifice means ⁰
on the Kalends of March, and I a bachelor? On this day I was delivered
from death, and it shall be a holiday. Come, Maecenas, a hundred cups of
my oldest wine to the health of thy friend. Away with anxiety. The Da-
cian has fallen, the Mede is dividcd against himself, the Cantabrian is in
chaine, and the Scythian has unstrung his bow. Be here the private gentle-
man : never mind the people; enjoy thyself and unbend.

l. Martiis eadelm] The Matronaiia, or feast of married persons in honor
of Juno Lucina, when husbands made presents to their wives, and offered
prayers for the continuanee of happiness in their married life, was celebrated

on the first of March.
2. acer-m thuris] This is the proper word for a box of frankincense

(λιβανωτίς). The derivation is uncertain.

4. Caespite υἰυο,] ‘on au altar of green turs! See C. i. 19. 13.

5. Docte sermones utriusque linquae 7] These words express a man well
read in the literature of Greece and Rome. Elsewhere he addi-esses his pa-
tron as ‘ Maecenas docte ' (Epp. i. 19. 1).

6. dulces epulas] A solemn sacrifice was commonly followed by a banquet,
at which libations were poured to the god to whom the sacrifice had been
offered. · .

7. Lt'bero caprum prope funeratus] This last word is not found in any other
writer earlier than Pliny. He and others after him use ‘funero' for ‘to
bury! Horace hene attributes to Liber the deliveranee he had before attrib-
uoed to Mercu ‚ Fanum, and the Muses, successively (see C. ii. 17. 28, n.).

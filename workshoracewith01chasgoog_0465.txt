P. 304), and ‘⁴ Actoris partes chorus officiumque virile Defendut” (v. 193). ·
On ‘mossoss see S. 3. 12. 'rho combination Horace commendas is that of the
orator stemly or gmvely rebuking vice, of the numerous satirist (ε pomae ²)-
bromssy ridiculing it, and of the polished wit, who, instead of throwing him«.

as a &rainer of ‘ mimae‚' like Hemogenes‚ with whom he is associated. We

‘ quine puoetin' the intermgative enclitic is somewhnt redundata, but not
more than in many other instances, as S. ii. 2. 107, and 3. 295. 317. ·

22. Riwdr'oqzwd Pitholeonti} This person is unknown. His name mol».
ably was Pithokms3 if so, Horace changed that termination in conformity

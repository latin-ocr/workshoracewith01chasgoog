utriusque linguae ’³ (C. iii. 8. 5). Cantium, theugh he lived to a good old

‘ age, and kept his powers to the last, as we have seen (S. i. 4. ·1, n.)‚ was a

proverbial dru'nkard. . .

4. Adscripsit Liber ‘Adscribere ’ is a military term. As to Liber’s at-
tendants, the Fauns‚ ans, and Sat rs, sce note on C. ii. 19. 4. The poets
immediately under the protection o Dionysus were the l ric, the dithyramb
having been performed first at the Dionysia. Compare C. i. l. 31. So the

t is called “ cliens Bacchi '’ (Ep . ii. 2. 78). Liber, the Latin divinity, is

ere, as elsewhere, confounded wit the Greek Bacchus or Dionysus, with

whom he had only this in common, that he presided over vines. ‘ Ut ' means
ᾖ ever since' (C.= iv. 4. 42). ,

5. Vina fere dulces] The ancients did not spare the reputation of their
poets in this matter3 for besides the fame of Cratinus mentioned above,
AlcaeuS, Anacreon, AEschyluS, Aristophanes, and many otherS, have the ,
credit of indulging freely in wine. As to Homer, there is no foundation
in his poeti-y for Horaee's libel, which is simply absurd. David might as
well be charged with excess because he speaks of wine as making glad the
heart 0ss man. Ennius said of himself that he only wrote when he had got
the gout : ’ “ Nunquam poetor nisi podager.'' ·

8. Forum putealque Libonis] See S. ii. 6. 35, n. Hora& speaks as if he
had delivered an ‘ edictum ' that the business of the Forum was only fit for
the sober. and dull, who had nothing to do with poetry 3 whereupon all that
would be thought poets took to drinking day and night. ‘ Putere ’ is a
stronger word for ‘ olere,' used above, v. 5. .

12. Quid, si quis vulta torvo] Cato of Utica is here referred to, of whom
Plutarch says, that from his childhood hc showcd in ..his voice and counte-
nance, and also in his amusements, an immovable‚ unimpressive‚ and firm
temper. He seldom laughcd‚ or even smiled; and though not passionate,
when· his anger was roused it was not easy to pacify him. He set himself
against the fashions of the times, in dress as in other things, and osten went
out of doors after dinner without his shoes and tunic ; and the fashion being
to wear a ‘lacerna ’ of bright color, he chose to wear a dark one. (Cat. c.
l. 6.) He may have worn his toga of smaller dimensione than other pcople‚
from the same dislike to the usages of the day. For ‘textore' we should
&fga Rtttffiuxgrbgamtrtns irhffbnis] It a pears that the person here called
Iarbitas (from Virgil’s Numidian king, farbas) was a Mauritania-n by birth,
and that his Roman name was Cordus or Codrus. Timagenes was a native
of Alexandria, where he was taken prisoner by A. Gabinius, and sold as a
slave. He was sent to Rome, and bought b Faustus, the son of Sulla, who
gave him his freedom. He afterwards taught rhetoric, and became famous.
It seems that Cordus, endeavoring to imitate TimageneS, and failing‚ broke
his beart with env .

18. biberent enaiim cuminum] The fruit of this plant, which is a pleasant
condiment,· is described bv Pliny (xx. 15) as giving a pallid hue to the com·
plexion. It is a plant of Eastern origin. We are familiar with it through
the proverbial use of the name by our Lord in his denunciation of the Phari-
sees‚ who gave tithcs of mint, anise, and cumin, but neglected the weightier
matters of the law. It was used to express littlcness or meariucss, in any
shape. Horace says, if he happened to look pale by any· chance, his im-
itators w‘guld eat cumin-seeds to make themselves look interesting and poet-
ical like im. ·

quanter vindicta quaterque] ‘' Vindicta’ is used for the ‘ festuca-‚⁹ οι· rod,
laid upon the shoulder of a slave by the praetor, iu the act of giving him his
freedom. Davus says that manumission, repeated -over and over again
(though that. involves «an absurdity), could not deliver his master, as he
called himself, from the bondage he was under to the world.

73. ἰἈἄιιίε ειυρεν dictis] ‘Dietis ' is governed by, ‘adde,' and ‘ supcr’ is
nse a so ute v.

79. vicariusJ The property a slave might accumulate was called his ⁶ pe·
culium,’ and among·the rest he might have :if-vicarius? a slave to do his
duty or help him iu it. He was held tobe ‘quasi dominus' in relation to·
his ‘ vicarius! What Davus 'says is, whether you choose to call the slave’s
slave'his ‘vicarius‚' or substitute, as your law does, or his follow-slave (as
strictly speaking he is, for, except-‘by suffernnce, a slave can hold no property
independent of his master)‚what is my relation to you ’.ἱ I am your slave3
you are the slave o'f your passionS, which will pull you about as the stringe

pull a puppet (which the'Greeks called νευρόσπαστον). The ancients car-
ried their mechanical skill in the construction of automaton figures further,-
perhapS, than it has .. been carried since. Artists in this line were common.
among the Greeks, and were called mvndo-naorat, αὐτοματουργοί. It ap·-
pears from Herodotus (ii. 48) that ἀγάλματα νευρόσπαστα, as he calls them,
were ‚in use >among the Egyptians. ⁴ '

83. sibi qui imperiosus,] ‘ IIe who ha's control over himself? Before
Horace, no writer uses this word with a case after it.
ι 85. Responsura cupidz'nibtw‚] ‘Responso ’ is repeated in Epp. i. l. 68.
“Fortunae responsare superbae.” It seems to mean, to reply to on equal
terms, and so to· be a match for, and to ovcrcome. The construction of the
adjectige aad infinitivo is common in the Odes, but not in the Satires or Epis-
ties. ee . i. 1. 16 n.
Δ 86. iu se ipso totus: teres, atque rotundus,] ‘In himself entire, smoothed,
and rounded,' that is, perfect as a sphcre‚ and, astho next line explains,
like a beautiful statue whose graees are all in itsclf‚ which is perfectly finished
and polished. This is elsewhere cxpressed by ‘ ad unguem fac-tus homo ’
(S. i. 5. 32, n.), the differenee in the mode of expression being, that here it
is meant there are no inequalitics on the surfaee on which anything at all ean
rest. The other expression has been explained in its place. “ In se ipso ,
totus,' means one who wants nothing from without to set him off, and whose
resources, as well as his graees, are all in himself. The mud through which
he passes as he goes through the world does not adhere to him (ι externi ne
quid valeat per leve morari ') ; circumstances, prosperous or tho reverse, do
not affeet his cha-tactem and, in all her assaults upon his happiness, Fertur-ie
proves but feeble, not being able to make any impression upon it. ‘Maricas’
means lame in the hand, as ‘claudus' does in the foot. ‘Teres' is'cx-
plained in a note on C. i. l. 28. ‘Rotundus’ is taken from the heavens,
which· Plato (Tim. p. 33) says the Deity σφαιροειδὲς ε’τορνεῦσατο, as being
most after his own image.
ι 89. Quinque talenta] The Attio drachma of this period was worth about
the sameas the Roman denarius, nearly 8:}d. (See above, v. 43, n.) The
mina. was equal to 100 drachmae, and a taient to 60 minae. It was worth
therefore about 212l.‚ and five talents 1‚060L The caprice of the man’s· mis-
tress is described as before, S. 3. 260, sqq.
χ 92. Non quis ,·] This is the second person of ‘queo'

95. Pausiaca torpes, insane, tabella‚] Pausias was a native of Sicyon, one
of the Πιθεῖ celebrated schools of art, where there was a large collection of
his pietures. Many were sold by the Sievonian government, to pay their
. debts, and most. of these found their way to Rome. His pietates were chiefly
small, ‘ tabellae‚’ and among the most celebrated was‘the pertrait of his

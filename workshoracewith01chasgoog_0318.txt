ODE XII.

This Ode is addressed to Maecenas, and, from the langnage of it, we might
suppose he had asked Horace to write something on a higher subject than he
was accustomed to. Horgzce tells him that his l re is not suited to wars and
triumphe, but he loves to sing of the beauty'of icymnia, under which name
it is supposed he means Terentia, the wife of Maeeenas. They may at this
time have been lately married, but they did not long continue to live happily.

Anoumnnr. -Do not· ask me with my soft lyve to sing of bloody wat-s,
of centaurs, and of giants: as fou· the triumphs of Oaesar, Maecenas, thou
couldst tell them better in prose than 1 ean in verse. My task is to sing of
the beauty and faithfulneea of Iicymnia, who graoes the danne aad sporta
with the damsels on Diana's holiday. Wouldst thou, for all the wealth of
gemin, Phrygia, and Α < bia, give a look of Licymnia’s hadr, or one of her

7. Telluris juvenes,] The Gigantes, who were called γηγενεῖς, ἐαηίἱ-δοτπ,’
made war upon ZeuS, and were destroyed by him with the help of Hercules,
and the bow and arrows given him by Apollo. Horace gives Bacchus the

credit of their defeat in C. ii. 19., 2l,sqq., and Pallas in C. iii. 4. 57, where
Hercules is not mentioned.

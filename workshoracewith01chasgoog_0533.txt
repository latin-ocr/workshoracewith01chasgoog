(Epp. 17: 417. ‘Lucus ' is usually a grove dedicated to some divinity‚ and
Horace may meati' that themati had no' regard for what others held sacred,
but· connted' a consecrated 'rove no better than any other wood. Or, since
‘inens ’ was sometimes use v indifferentl for any wood, Horace may mean,
‘if yon think virtue co‘nsists only of wo s, as a grove does of trees?

33. Ne &illm-asion] ‘ Cibyra Major ³ was situated on a branch of the In-
dns, o'n the northwest borders of Lycia.. It was called ‘ magei-,2 to distinguish
it from a smaller town on' the coast of Pamphylia. Twenty-five towns be-
longed ,ω the conventus of Cibyra,- and its ·conimercial transactionis were
probably large. A's to ‘Bithyna negoti& see C. iii. 7. 3, n. - ‘Negotia' is

38. Suadela Venusque] ‘ Suadela' is another form of Suada, who repre-
sented the Greek divinity Πειθώ, Persuasion. The name, Cicero tells us,
was Latinized by Ennius (Brut. 15). Πειθώ was usually associated with

Ἀφροδίτη. ‚and their statues stood together at Athens, where it is pretty eer-
tain Horace must have seen them. 1 cannot find that Suada had any temple
or separate worship at Rome. She was supposed· to assist Venus in {nesid-
1ng at mai-nages, and she, the Graece, and Mercury were the acknow edged
companions of that goddess. Therefore, Horace associates them here. Chigefg

114. Et vei-seam adhuc] This is. a way of sayin that the verses, though
they may be expunged, still are kept in the authoxgs desk, because he has a
regard for them, and cannot make up his mind to desti-oy them. The sanc-
tuary of Vesta could only be entered by her own priestesses‚ and Horace calls
his desk ‘ penetralia Vestae ’ because 1t was private.

116. speciosa vocabula rer-mm] ‘Expressive terms'3 words which make·

themselves intelligible at once. So in A. Ρ. 319 a play is said to be ‘speci-
osa lociS,’ that ie, ‘ plain in its points,' its commonplaces or sentiments
ele1al¹l7y ggttam'bus a e Cetheqis] As to the use of the plin-al number, se'e

note on S. i. 7. 8. . Porcius Cato Censorius was born about Β. c. 2345

and was therefore contemporary with Eanum, with whom he is associated,
A. Ρ. 56, as suceessfully importing new words into the language. Fragments
remain of his treatise De Re Rustica, embracing a variety of nisu-uotions on
husbandry and subjects connected with domestic economy; and of his Ori-
ineS, an account of the early history of Italy. There are also fragments of⁴²

's oration8‚ which Cicero appears to have studied (Brutusffi. 17). He had
the highest opinion of Cato, and complains that he was not studied enough
even in his day. M. Cornelius Cethegus was older thau Cute, since he was
curule aedile when Cato was no more than twenty. His eloquence was such
that Ennius called Cethegus “ Suadae medulla, ¹orator suaviloquenti ore.”
(Cic. Brut. c. 15 3 Cat. Maj. c. 14; see Epp. i. 6. 36, n.) But it does not
appear that any of his orations were extant in Cicero's time, sor he only·
mentions them on the authority of Ennius, who had heard himspeak. His

reputation was sufficient at the time Horace wrote, for him to name himtwice ·’

as an authority on the language (see A. P. 50, n.). V
119. quae yenitor produxerit nsua] ‘ Usus ’ is ‘ custom,' which has always
been the arent of novelties in language. Compare A. P. 7 0, sqq.

S 12ίέ 67εὴωπεπε] The first two syllables are pronounced as one. Compare
. 1. . .

123. virtute carentia tollet‚] ‘ He will remove what lacks merit? He will

work hard to produce a result which shall appear playsul and easy, the turns ’ ,

being as easy as those of the ⁸ mimuS,' who (lances either th⁶e light measure
of the nimble Satyr, or the clumsy dance of the Cyclops (on which see S. i.
5. 63, n.). The poet’s art is to conceal his art, and to make that appear
easy which has cost him a good deal of trouble.

126. Praetulerim scriptor] This is supposed to be the remark of one who
would be a poet without the necessary trouble. He would rather be pleased
with his own bad verses, even though he might be deceiving himself, than be
so le ed and be perpetually vexcd ‚with himself. ‘ Ringere’ is properly
applie to the grinning of a dog when it snarls.

128. Fuit haud &nobilis Arpi-53] Sir chry Halford furnishes a· parallel
story (Essays‚ p. 61): “ One case, that of the gentleman of ArgOS, whose
delusion led him to suppose that he was attending the representation of a

play, as he sat iu his bedchamber, is so exact, that Ι saw a person of ·

exalted rank Georgo ΙΙΙ.) under those very circumstances of delusion,
‘fud heard him call upon Mr. Garrick to exert himself in the performance

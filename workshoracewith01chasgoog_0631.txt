Eftract from ιΙιο Prefacs.

‘⁶ The object of this little volume is to place in the hands of Greek studente in the
United states a book, which may exhibit the present state of the Greek language‚ as
written and spoken by cultivated men, and the character of the popular language
ἐι exhibited in those simple and beautiful poeme, the Klephtic ballads -and the
festive songs of christopoulos. 'I'he selectione have been made with particular
reference to the history and condition of GreeceJ 1 have limited myself to a few
authors, and have taken only passages bearing upon the subject and having en
interest and value or themselves. Of the numerous discourses delivered on various
occasions, Ι have selected only two. Both, 1 think, are distinguished for their
eloquence and the great «interest that attaches to the memory of those whom they
commemorate. Their authors are among the most eminent of the living Greeks.
. .. . . 'rho few Klephtie hames hem offered to tho mador are such aa exhibit the
tone of thought and feeling among the slmple and hardy people in the midst of
whom they spontaneously sprang up3 or such as celebrate heroes and heroic acts
during the 'rurkish domination and the war of the Revolution. On account of its
historic-,el importance, as well as its martial spirit, 1 regarded the War-Song of
Rhegas as a fitting close to these strains of n‘ative poetry. · The grace and gayety of
christopoulos‚ and his delicate poeticel genius, induced me to end the volume with
a· few specimens of the anacm‘ontie songs of this savorite author. The few notes at

the end are intended only to explain words and phrases which cannot be easily ' ⁹

. made out by one familiar with the Ancient Greek, and with some Modern Greek
(hammer, —as that of Mr. Sophocles.

“The Greek, as spoken' at the present day, is substantially the language that ’
was spoken in the Alexandr-ine and Byzantina periods ; but there are Important dis-
tinctions between the ancient and modern, growing out of changes in the structure
no less than modificatione of the meaning of words. Neerly all the words now em·
ployed by educated Greeks are the same that were used by their ancestors3 but

the grammar of the language is moder-m . . . . 'l'he book is intended ιο be read in

connection with the Ancicnt Greek 3 and so reading it, the student will find few ' ’

difficulties, except in the dialectic peculiarities of the popular poetry, or the titles
ot} official end other persons, which belong wholly ιο modern history.”

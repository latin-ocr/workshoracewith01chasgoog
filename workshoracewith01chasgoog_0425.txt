43. Quod si comminuas] The miser is supposed to interrupt, and say, “ But
if you were to take from it, it would soon dwiudle to a paltry ‘ as.' '⁹ ⁴ Quod ’
is always the neuter of the relative, but here, >as often elsewhere, it is used to
connect a new sentence with what precedes, and is not connected with ‘ pon-
dus ' as its antecedent. ·

45. Meuia frumenti] ‘ Modiorum ' must be supplied. As to ‘ millia?
‘mille,’ see Sv ii. 3. 197, n. On ‘area,' see C. i. 1. 10, n. ‘Triverit,’ ‘sup-
pose that it threshes.’ This is the concessive use of the subjunctive. The
practice of putting a note of interrogation in such sentences as this is ex-
pioded. The older editions genet-all have it. · similar constructione are S.
10. 64, “Fuerit Lucilius inquam omis et urbanus3 fucrit limatior—sed

different burdens, and some with none at all. The man who carried the
bread would not get any more of it on that account, when the latinns were
given ont, but all would shaoe alike.

49. Quid referat—viventi] ‘ Refert ’ is ‘ rem fert) and the construction
‘ mea‚' ‘ tua,' etc.; ‘ refert’ is no more than a corruption of ‘ meam‚' ‘ tuain‚'
etc„ ‘ rem fert! So ‘ magni refert’ is ‘ rem magni fcrt,’ ‘it brings with it a
matter‘of great pricc,’ and ⁴ refert viventi ' signifies ‘it brings something that

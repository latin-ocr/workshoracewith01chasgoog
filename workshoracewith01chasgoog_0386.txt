gf slander in respect to his personal 'character-‚ywhieh Horace here warinly
defende, but which in after years was much blackened. There seems to be
no other way of accounting for the -earnestness with which Horace declares
his friend’s innocence of the vice of avarice, for instance, than to suppose
that fault-had been laid to his charge, as it was so fneely after his death (see
Inffdggfflhlividas] The plural ‘ obliviones ' is nowhere else used. ‘ Car.
pere' is used in the sense of gradually consuming, and has something like
that meaning here. ‘Lividus’ is akin to the Gueek πελιδνός, and to the
Latin ‘luridus' (C. iii. 4. 74, n.). It means ‘dark,' and is commonly as-
sociate-d with envy, which connects it with oblivion caused by envy. Horace
says ‹lark oblirion shall· not swallow up the labore οξ Lollius with impunity3

· “Cato multarum rerum usum habebat '’ (Cic.t‹le Am. ii. 6) expresses the

same kind of experience. ‘Rectus’ means ‘erect‚’ not stooping or bowed
down, as “Fana deos habuere rectos '’ (C. iv. 4. 48). Sec also Ennius,
quoted by Cicero (De Senect. c. 6) : “ Quo vobis menteS, rectae quae stare
solebant Antehac, dementes sese flexere viai ’ὲ ”

the highest magistrates; and such ever was Lollius, besieged like others with. ,

41. Judex honestum] That it should be a matter of gmat merit and diffi-
culty to maintain the character of an uncorrupt judex, does not say m‘uch
·for the honesty of those who exercised the functione of iurors. The corrup-2
tion of the senatoriam body led to the judicial power being transferred from
them to the equites, but they in their turn were found so corrupt that it was
given back to the senatores, and afterwards the judiees were selected from
both orders. See S. i. 4. 123, ιι. ’ ἱ

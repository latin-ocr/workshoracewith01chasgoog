-i Bo. Quisquis erit uitae scn'b'am colon] This icos'e collocation oi· words is 11111
nncommon in Horace. It ou ht not to be imitated. ” .
. O puer, ut sis] See Intro uction. This sentence illusit-ates the rule re-
specting verbs of fearing, that they “have the subjunctive with ‘ne’ if the·
object be not desired, with ‘ ut ’ if it be desired '' (Key’s L. G. 1186), to which
the note is “ Observe that the Latin inserts a negative where the English has
110116, 61111 vice versa '' ’

64. Detrahet-eet pellem,] Compare Epp. i'. 16. 44. Each of the Scipiones
had a Laelius for his intimate companion. This is C. Laelius SapienS, the
friend of P. Scipio Africanus Minor, anfi well known through Cicero’s trca-'
tises ‘ De Senectute ’ and ‘ De Amicitia,’ in the former of which heis a listen-
er, in the latter the principal speaker. As to the following verse, see C. iv.
8. 18, 11. Lucilius was on term! of close intimacy with these two friends.

· 67. Metello] Q. Caecilius Metellus had the cognomen Macedonicus given “

him, for his successes against Andriscus, the pretender· to the throne of Per·
sens, king of Macedonia. Horace means to say that Scipio and Laelius were
not offended at the wit of LuciliuS, nor feared it might turn upon themselves,
when they saw him attack Metellus. Why he did,so is uncertain.

e 68. Lupo] Who Lupus was is not certain. His name appears in many
ot the fragments of Lucilius. The most probable person is L. Cornelius
Leutulus Lupus, who was consul B. c. 156. What he 11611 done 1ο provoke
Lucilius's satine we do not know, but Cicero (De Nat. Dcor. i. 23) has pre-
served a verse of his in which Lupus is elassed with the perjured and prof-
hgj‘itteffi Primores populilr ‘Atqui‚' which is a form of ‘ at quin‚' means ‘ but
' he did, did he not ’.ἱ ’ ’ ributim,’ throughout all the tn‘bes · 116 attacked the

optimates and plebeians, and all without distinction. As to the tribes, seee

Epp. i. 6. 52, n. ‘ Ae uus’ means ‘l‘avorablc to.’ -
· 72. Virtus Scipiadae On this form, sce above, v. 17. 866 6130 S. i. 2.

32, n.‚ on the expression ‘ virtus Scipiadae! Laelius, as above mentioned, ⁸

had the cognomen Sapiens given him, andany one who reads Cicero’s treae
tise that bears his name will understand Horace¹s epithet ‘mitis’ One of
the Scholiasta relates a story of Laelius running round the dinner-table, and
Lucilius pursuing him with a napkin‚ to flog him. Lucilius was born B. c.
148, and Scipio died Β. c. 129. Η6 was therefore but a boy when he thus
played with these friends; and if, as Horace's language implies, he wrote
satires in Scipio’s -lifetimc‚ they were probably the mere intemperate sallies
of youth. But Horace may be mistaken. The fare of these great men was
of the simplest kind. (See note on S. i. 6. 115.) ’

- 75- Infra Lucili censam] Horace had before intimated (v. 34, n.) that he,
a poor man’s son, born in a· provincial town, was not to be compared with
LuciliuS, a Roman citizen, who was rich, and had a fine house in the Forum.

78. nisi quid 111,] Τ1113 13 equivalent to saying, ‘ This is what I think, Tre·
batius; but Ι shall be glad 1ο defer to your, opinion if you differ from me!

79. nihil hinc diffindere possum] The meaning of ‘ diffindere' is not quite
clear. Perhaps it has the same sense as ‘secare' above‘ffi. i. lo. 15, ¹and
Epp. i. 16. 42) ; 1116113, ‘to decide.' If so, Trebatius says he cannot decide
the question fr0m the premises Horace has put before him (⁸ hinc ').

80. Sed tamen] By the XII. Tables, the writing of scurrilous verses was
among the few offences that were punishable with 1166111. 866 Dict. Antt.,
:Art- ‘ Injuria,' 61111 compare Epp. ii. 1. 153. There was a ‘lex Cornelia de
injuriis,' which probably included the offence of writing scurrilous verses.
When Trebatius says there is ‘jus judiciumque‚’ he means that there 131661,
and also there are legal proceedingS, for this case. ‘ Ne forte ’ is used as in
C. ἰν. 9, 1, where see note, and 6011111616Ε11ρ. i. 1. 13 ; 18. 58; 11. l. 208.
‘, Sanctarum ’ is a participle, ¹ quae sanciuntur! ’ 86116116 legem ' was to
affix.the penalty to a ‘lex,’ and so give it effect. See Cic. de Am. c. 12. ⁴.

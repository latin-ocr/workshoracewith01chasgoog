See Introduction.

‹ 4. qravibzcs] Tliis epithet is applied to the Parthians before (C. i. 2. 22).

‘5. Milesne Crassi] It was about twenty-eight years since the disastrous
campaign of CrassuS. Orelli says Horace does not allude to M. Antonius's
losses in the same quarter eighteen years afterwardS, partly because it would
have been indelicate towards AugustuS, and partly because of his affection
for his son, L. Antonius.

conjuye barbara — maritus} ‘ married to a barbarian wife.’ ‘ Vixit ' is em-
phatic, since they married to save ,their lives. (Aen. viii. 688.) The disgrace
la'y in their intermarrying with those who not only had not ‘connubium'
with Rome, but were her enemies. · .

’7. Pro curia inversique mores !] ‘ Pro ’ expresses vehemence varying in
kind according to circumstances. Itis followed by the nominative or aceu-
sative. In the common exclamation, ‘⁴ Pro deum hominumque fidem l '' the
accusative is always used. The Curia (called Hostilia, because it was said to
have been built by Tullus Hostilius) was the senate-house, and the exclama-
tion in the text is, “ Alas for our senate and our altered manners l ”

8. m armis] The Roman prisonem may have served in the Parthian
armies. .

-9, Marsus et Apulus,} See C. ii. 20. 18, n. It does not appear that the
Apulians were particularly good soldierS‚ but the states of Italy all furnished
troops (⁴ socii ’), and the Roman army is here referred to. . Perhaps Horace
added the Apulians to the Marsi through affection for his native state.

10. Anciliorum] This genitive, from ‘ancile,’ is anomalous. Forcellini
peints out a similar irregularity iu ‘ Saturnaliorum,' and Orelli adds ‘ spon·
saliorum.’ The ‘ancilia ’ were twclve·shieldS, of which, according to tradi· “
tion, eleven were made by order of Numa after the pattern of one that was
found in his house, and was supposed to have corne down from heaven. It -
was prophesied, that while the ‘ ancile’ was reserved, Rome should survive.
The ‘ancilia' were kept by the priests of ars (Salii) in his temple. By
‘togae ' is meant his citizenship, since none but Roman citizens wore the
toga. Horace collects the most distinguished objects of a Roman’s reverence,
his name, his citizenship <⁴ togae ⁹), the shield of Mars, only to be lost, and the
fire of Vesta, only to be extinguished, when Rome should perish. ,

12. Incolumi Jove] That is, ‘ while the Capitol is safe‚’ which was Jove's
temple.

15. exemplo trahentis] Horace means to say, that Regulus had soreseen .

the danger to posterity of a precedent which should sanction the purchase 'of
’ life upon dishonorable terms. ‘ This the far-seeing mind of Regulus guarded
against, 'when he refused to agree to dishonorable conditionS, and drew from
such a precedent a presa e of rnin upon generations to come.'

17. st non periret, etc. ‘ If the prisoners were not left to die unpitied.'

18. Caplimz pubes] In the year 13. c. 256, during the first Punic war, M.
Atilius Regulus, being consul, invaded Africa, and after many successes,
taking many towns and laying waste the country, he was terribly defeated
and taken prisoner with 500 others. After he had been five ears a prisoner,
the Carthaginians sent him to Rome to negotiata peace, which, at his own
instigation, was refused. He returned, and according to the general account
was put to death, it is said with tortum, but that may'be an invention.

22. τεν-90] Dative, for ‘in tergum.’

23. Portasque non clausas] ‘ the gates (of Carthage) wide open.’ Tho
same image of security appears in A. P. 199 ε “ Et apertis otia portis.’' No

attempt was made to carry the war into Africa after Regulus's defeat, though
it lasted fourteen years longer.

ODE XXIV.

Quinc-rums Vnius was born at Cremona, and was a neig‘hbor and friend
of Virgil, through whom it is probable Horace made his acquaintance. He
is referred to in the Epistle to the PisoneS, v. 438, sqq., as a discerning critic.

Ascensum—What bounds shall be set to our grief for one so dear‘.²
Teach us a mournful sti-ain, Melpomene. Can it be that Quinctilius, whose
like Modesty, J ustice, Fidelity‚ and Truth shall not behold again, is gone to
his evcrlasting rest? Many good men mourn for him, but none more truly .
than· thou, Virgil. ’T was not for this thou didst commit him to the care of
Heaven. But in vain thou dost ask him back. The lyre of Orpheus could
not bring him to life again. ’Tis hard to bear: but patience makes that
lighter which no power can change. ⁴

in which the soul was supposed to dwell after death, called by the Greeks

in Heaven, Diana on Barth, and Hecate in Heln whence Virgil speaks of
“ Ter-geminamque Hecaten tria virginis ora Dianae '’ (Aen. iv. 511), alluding

ODE XXIII,

Romen, wishing to embody the principle that any offen-ing to heaven is
acceptable according to a rnan’s means (sffiligoss (ἔτι ζέὲῐξ,οῐέιὶῐί8ὴο 311ξο ege

1. supinas] The clasping of the hands in prayer does not seem to have
been usual with the ancients. ‘ Supinas ' and ὕπτιος co'ntnin the same ele.-
ment, and both signify ‘ uptumcd! The ‘ s ’ in the Latin word eoa-iesponds
to the inspirate of the Greek, as in ‘silva’ and ὕλη. As to ‘ nascente Luna‚⁸
see C. iii. 19. 9, n. Phidyle is deri-ved from φείδεσθαι, and means ‘thfisty.’
The prose form of ‘ hornus ' is ‘ hornotinus! · ’

4. Lares] These were the Manes or spirits of deceased members of a stim-

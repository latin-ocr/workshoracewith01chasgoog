'teaching of their ‘ paedagogi‚’ and afterwards (till they assumed the ‘ toga
virilis,’ and in some cases longer) at the ‘ludi literarii,’ private schools which
they attended as day scholare. ,, .

79. ‚In magno ‘uc populo‚] ‘So far as one could see me in such a busy
crzvgdcwoe {ncorm tissimus] The ‘ paedagogus ' (‘ eustos 'kwhose office was
of late growth at ome, and horrowed from Greece, had t e same functione

as the παιδαγωγός among the GreekS, and was a slavaas there. He was
continually about the boy's person, and went with him to his masters. This
,task Horace’s father, who, could have had but few slaves, and had none whom
he could trust with such important dutieS, performed himself. Besides the
‘paedagogus,’ as observed above (v. 74, n.), other slaves went with the boy,
to carry his bag, lete„ and to give him consequence. ' ,

86. praem—coactor] The first of these functionaries was-a crier‚ either at
auctions (one of his duties being to induce persons to attend-and buy, see A.
vP. 419), or in courts of justice, or the public assemblies. There was a ‘ prae-
co ' at all punishments and executione, to declare the crime of the offender
ῼῖροᾶ. ἰν. 12, n.); also town-cricrs, who cried lost property, as with us.
here were other kinds of criers. Which class Horace refers to, we cannot
tell. Nor is it decided what class of ‘ coactores ’ his father belonged to.
There were persons employed b the ‘ publicani ’ to collect the revenue, and
'who were, called ‘ coactores! he person who collected the money bid at
an auction, was also a ‘ coactor,' and, generally, persons employed to collect
money bore that title. It is probable that the ‘coactores ' of the first class

· made a' good deal of money. Matthew the Apostle was one, and he was

rich. It is generally believed that the elder Horace belonged to the second

'of the above classes, and some color is given to this by the association of the

, ‘word with ‘ praeco! But ‚Suetonium or the author of Horaee's life attributed.
to him, says that he was in the employ of ‚the ‘ publicani!

J 87. at Ιιοο nunc ‘ Hoe‚’ in the sense of ‘propter hoc‚' ἐπὶ τούτῳ, is com·

,monly uged by orace. See in this satire, vv. 41 and 52. It is also com-

mon m aesar. ·

89. Nil me poeniteat sanum ‘ Ι hope while 1 have my senses Ι may never

be ashamed.’ Horace usest is mode of expression elsewhere, as in the last
Satire, v, 44, and S. ii. 3. 322. . -

ζ 90. dolo} ‘ Dolus ' is used like ‘ fraus ' in C. i. 28. 30, for a fault generally:

‘ dolo suo, ‘by his own fault! ⁴ .

, 93. Et vox et ratim] ‘ My language and my judgment!

. 94. Α certis annis] ‘ From any given period.’. He means that, at all fimes

' ‚from his cradle upwards, his father had been to him all that a father could

be.. ‘ Legere ad fastum,' to choose with reference to ambition whatever

parents each man might desire. We know nothing of Horace’s mother, „

whom he probably lost in very early life3 but he here intimates his respect
‚for her memor-y, as well as his father’S.

· · 97. Fascibus et sellis] The ‘ fasces ’ were bundles of stickS, with or without

Jan. axe in the middle, which were carried before the consuls and praetors by
lictors. The ‘ sella curulis ' was a chair ornamented with ivory, the use of
..which during the republic was confined to the consule, praetore, curule aediles,
‘and' censore. · , . 7 .

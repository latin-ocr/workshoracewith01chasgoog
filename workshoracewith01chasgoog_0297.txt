7. Liris] This river, now called Garigliano, took its rise near the Lacus
Fucinus, in the country of the Alqui, and, passing through the richest part
of Latium, emptied itself below Minturnas into the sea (S. i. 5. 40, η.). *he
upper part of the stream is much broken by waterfalls. Horace's description
applies only to the lower part, where, havi lest the Apennines and joined

‘the Trerus (saeco), it flows quietly thro h t e cultivated lands of Latium.

9. Fremant] Virgil uses this word in t e same sense (Georg. i. 157) ι “et
ruris opaci Falce premes umbras”; and Ovid (Met xivx 629). ‘Calena’
is nansfexred fro'mthe vine to t‘he knife, as ih: Sabina diota ’ (9. 7 ), ‘ Laestry-'

wine itself. As to Calenian wine, see C. 20. 10, n.

12. Vina Sym reparata merce,] Wine taken in exchange sor Syrian goods,
which includes all the costly merchandise of the East; elsewhere czulctl
‘ Tyriae merces! The seaports of Syria were entrepots for goods from and
for the East‚ and wem frequented by‘a vast number of ships from all parts, —
Horace uses many words compounded with ‘ re ' without any perceptible
differenee of meaning from the simple worda, as ‘ retractare‚' ⁴ resecaress ‘ re-
solvere,’ ‘ revincere: ‘ renare,’ ‘ remittere! But there is the force of hartering
in this word, as in ἀνταγοράζεσθαι. (See C. i. 37. 24, n.) ‘ Mercator ’ was
a dealer in wares who generally sailed or travelled into foreign parta. The
‘ mercatores ' were an enterprising class, and penetratcd into barbarous and
distant countries and dangerous seas. The mention of the Atlantic is a little
out of lace, immediately after ‘ Syra. merce’3 but, as usual, Horace writes

neral y, and does not aim at strict- accuracy. ‘ Aequor Atlanticum ' suited

is verse. The travelling merchants are often referred to by Horace. See
ci'i. 1. 153 iii. 24. 403 S. i. 1. 6, 4. 29. Epp. i. 1. 45, 16. τι, and else-
w ere.

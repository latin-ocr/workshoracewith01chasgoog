ODE IX.

“ Tms is 8 drinking son for the winter, imitated from an Ode of 111οω118.-
A party is su posed to {a assembled in the city, and one calls upon the,
master of the east to bring out his best wine, and make the fire burn bright,
that they may banish care and all thought for the future, since youth is the
time for innocent enjoyment.

Aneumnnr. — You see how Soracte stands out with snow, and the woods
are bending with their burden‚ and the sharp frost hath frozen the streamS.
Heap logs on the tire, and draw your best Sabine wine, feast-master,-and
leave the rest to the godS, at whose bidding the fierce winds are still and the·
woods have rest. Ask not what is to come 3 enjo the present day3 let the
dance be ours while we are young, the Campus artiuS, the promenade, the
nightly assignation, and the coy girl that loves to be caught.

1. stet] ‘stands out.' This signifies a fixed and prominent appearance.
‘ Stant lumina flamma' (Aen. vi. 300) ma be rendered in the same way.
Soracte was one of the Faliscan range osy hilis, about 2200 feet high and
twenty-four miles from Rome. It is now called Monte Trest0, a corruption
from ‘ San Oreste) It is seen very clearly srom th‘e northern point of the
city. Apollo had a temple there: “ Summe deum sancti custos Soractis
Apollo,” Aen. xi. 785.

4. constiterint] ‘ have ceased flowing! See Ov. Tr. v. 10. 1 : “ ’Ut sumus
in Ponto ter frigore constitit Ister.’' ‘ Acuto,' as applied to cold, corresponds
to the ὀξεῖά χιών of Pindar, and ⁴ penetrabile frigus ’ of Virgil. But Horace
also applies it to heat (Epp. i. 10. 17) : “ Cum semel accepit solem furi:
bandus acutum.” In English, we say ‘a sharp frost‚' but do not use the
same word for heat.

7. Deprome quadrimum Sabinam—diota] The first of these words means
here to draw the wine from the ‘ diota ’ into the ‘crater or bowl in which it was
mixed with water. The diota (so called from its having two handles or eat-S,

ὦτα) was the same as the ‘ amphora’ (so called for the same reason), ‘ testa‚'³
or ‘ cadnS,' which were names for the vessels of earthen-ware οι· glass in
which the wine was kept, as we keep ,it in bottleS, after it was· drawn 110111ἰ

ruther to sce what was going on, than to take any active part. He came to
Brundisium, but the-people would not let him come into the harbor (accord-
ing to Plutarch), aud he therefore went on to Tarentum. Negotiations were
carried ou between the two rivals (Caesar being at Rome) through agents
employed by both, but without effect, 'till Octavia undertook to media-te be-
tween her husband and brother, and was finally successful iu reconciling
them. It has been supposed, with every probability, that the mission which
Horace aec-ompanied was sent by Augustus to meet Antonius on bis expected
arrival at Brundisium, on this occasion. '

Horace. started from Rome with only one companion, Heliodorus the rhet-
orieiau (v. 2), and these two travelled together three days aud one night,
about fifty-six miles, till the reached Tarracina or Anxur, where, bv appoint-
ment, they were to meet the official members of their party. These were
Maecenas and Cocceius, who had been employed in negotiating the first
reconciliation between Augustus and Antonius (Β. e. 40), and Fonteius, an
intimate friend of the latter. Three days afterwards, they met at Sinuessa
Horace's three most intimate friends, Plotius Tucca, Varius, and Virgil;
one of whom, Varius, kept them company only for six days, and left them, ·
for reasons which are not mentioned. at Canusium (v. 93). The rest of the

arty went on together till they reached Brundisium, seventecn days after

oraee had left Rome. The route they took was not the shortcst or the
easiest, which lav through Venusia and Tarentum. Thev preferred taking
the noi-theaetern’road, which strikes across the country from Beneventum,
and, reaching the coast at Barium, continues along the 'shore till it comes to
Brundisium. ·They were evidently not presse-d for time, and probably took
the read they did because it passed through Canusium, whither one of the
party was bound. Maecenas made his joui-noy as agreeable as, under the
circumstances, it could be, by taking with him such companions3 and they
au appear to great advantage iu Horace's good-humorcd diary. There was
no restraint between the patron and his friends, and it is very pleasant to eon-
template their affection for 'him and one another. .

It is probable that, before Horace returned to Rome, he visited Tarentum
and his native place, Venusia, through which he would naturally pass. He
seems to have had in mind the description by Lucilius of a joumcy he took
to Capua, of which three or four verses only have been preserved (see note
on v. 6).

1. Eqressum manna me excepit Aricia] They left Rome by the Porta Ca-
pena, between Mons Aventinus and Mons· Caeliae, in the southern quarter of
‘the city. Aricia (La Riccia.)‚ one of the most ancient towns of Latium, was
sixteen miles from Rome. It was situated on· the side of a hill, sloping down
to a valley called Vallis Aricina, through which the Appia Via passed. This
part of the road is still in good preservation. The citadess was placed on the
top of the hill (Strabo, v. p. 239), and on that spot stands the modern town.
Aricia was a considerable town in Horaee's time, and for some centur-ies
after. Cicero calls it “ municipium—vetustate antiquissimum, splendore
municipum honestissimum '' (Phil. iii. 6). Its neighborhood to Rome, and
accessible position, contributed to its prosper-hy, which was assisted hy its
association with the worship 'of Diana Aricina, who had a temple among the
woods on the small lake (Lar-us Nemorensis), a short way from the town,
probably on the site of the modern town Nemi. The wealthy Romans had
villas in the neighhorhood.

By ‘ hospitio modico’ Horace means an indifferent inn ; but ‘hospitium ’ is
not the Latin for an ‘ inn‚’ which was called ‘ caupona‚’ or ‘ taberna,' or ⁴ di-
versorium‚’ and its keeper ‘caupo.’ The inns at the different stages on the

great reads were never3gery good, the chief reason being that travellers of

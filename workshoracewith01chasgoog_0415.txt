1. Μία-ῥοώδη] So virgil (Bel. iii. ⁵452 “ Sensibus haec imis (res est

non parva) reponas)
· 4. tinxerim] This is the earliest instance of this use of ‘traha' ⁶ ⁴ Duco ’
is more common (C. i. 17. 223 iii. 3. 343 iv. 12. 14). -Ovid and later
writers use ‘ traho ' (see For-cell). The Greeks used σπάω and ἕλκω com-
monly in this sense. ‘ Candide ³ seems to signify ‘ genereus‚’ ‘ true.’ It is
'used familiai-lv.

6. Deus] 'that is, love.

8. Ad mabiliam· adducere] The several sheets of parchment on which the
contente -of a book were written &vere joined together, and at the ..end of the
last was fastened a stick on which the whole was rolled‚ like our maps ; and
in the same way, at the ends of this tollor, were knobS, which were called ·
⁸ cornua' οι· ‘umbilici.’¹ The former word is obvious enough. The latter
belongs more proKerlss perhaps, to the shape that the ends of the roll would
take when ‘these no were want-inm but. it was also applied to the knobs
tlfiemselveS, „and so ‘ ad umbilicum adducere ’ is to bring a volumem the last
s eet.

It· has been disputed whether ‘ carmen ’ means a volume or a single phem.
·‘ Ad umbilicum adducere ' seems to refer to a volume, ‘ carmen ’ to a single
poem3 but the former might be taken in a derived sense, ‘ad finem addu-
cere,' as reasonablv as the latter in a collective sense, and Ι think asingle
poem is meant. Perhaps it never was finishcd. Whether ‘olim' belongs
to ‘inceptos ³ or ⁸ promissum ' is open to doubt. In sense it applies to

dresses to boys. The name of Bathyllus does not occur in any of the frug»
ments that have come down to· us; but. it is mentioned by others besides
Horace, and he is known to have been one of Anacreon's chief favorites.
He was a graceful perfonner on the flate, which accomplishment Anacreon
took delight in praising. One of the Odes falsely attributed to Anacreon is
addressed εἷς νεώτερον Βάθυλλον · aud from that we also learn that he was
a semitm, ἢν δ’ ἐς Σάμον ποτ’ ἔλθῃς Γ (ἱφε Φοῖβον ἐκ Βαθύλλου. Ana-

whom she has caught, and warns him that, be he rich and wxse as he may,
she win soon leave him for another. Horace introduces the same name in a.
much later Ode (iii. 14. 21), and it is used throughout the third book of
Elegies commonly attributed to Tibullus. The Ode is in Ovid's style, and
wei-thy to have beenwritten by him. ·

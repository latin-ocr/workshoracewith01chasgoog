(53.8’άιιρῐίσίε pernoscere juris] Catius goes on to describe the sauees, of
which there are two kinds ; one which he calis simple, but which was not en-
tirely so, being made of sweet olive-eil mixed with rich winennd ‘mnria,’
which is but ‘ganum' made from certain cheli-{ish (S. 8. 53). There was a
composite sance which was made up of the above boiled with chopped herm,
with a sprinkling of saffren, and, when it had swod to coel, the-fineen olive·
oil of Venafrum (C. ii. 6. 16, n.). -

. 73. Hanc eqo cum maiia} Catius says he was the first to introduce Alba-
nian raisins at the second course, and likcivise ‘flaex3 and ‘ allec: two pickles,
or two names for the same, being the lees of the ‘ muria ' (v. 63, n.). Catius
also claims the merit of introducing little dishes containing a mixture of salt
and white pepper. The object of all this, as well as the pickle8‚ was to pro-
mote thirst, and add to the pleasute of drinking after dinncr. white pepper
ι is milder than black. It is made by blanching the finer grains of the black,
- and taking off the riud. The ancien'ts must have got their pepperssnm the

79. calicem] The slave handing a drinking-cup (‘ mlix ³) to a guest, just]
after he had been >gatiam-ing and lieking up the tamaius of the dishes, would
leave the maske of his sing-crs upon it, and this would tarn the stomachs of
the company, who would also be disgusted if they saw dirt upon the ‘ cratera '5
in which the wine and the water were mixed. The ‘ calix ’ was the same as
the Greek κύλιξ. Its shapes and sizcs and materials all varied very much!
There were wooden and earthen-ware ‘ ealices,’ and others of common glaeS‚¹

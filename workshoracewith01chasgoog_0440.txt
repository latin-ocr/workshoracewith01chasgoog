wrong, and followed the beaten track, and would have his son do the same.
Horace expresses the same below, S. 6. 82, sqq. The whole of the passage
there should be 'compared with this. The elder Horace was no doubt a plain,
sensible man. As to ‘sapiens,' see C. i. 34. 2.

121. formabat] This is Horace's usual word for education. C. i. 10. 2 :
“ Qui feros cultus hominum recentum Voce formasti-'³ See C. iii. 24. 54, n.

123. Unum est judicibus selectis] It was the duty of the Praetor Urbanus
annnall to select a certain number of persons whose names were mgistemd
in the lhum ‚Indicum Selectorum, and from whom were chosen by lot the
‘judices ' for each trial. It is uncertain whether at this time, or by a subse-
quent ‘ lex ' of Augustus, their functions were extended to civil as well es

criminal proceedingS. The number of these ‘jndices' varied. B the ‘lex ,

Servilia Glaucia Repetundarum ' it was fixed at 450. The law t at was iu
force at the time Horace refers to was the ‘ lex Aurelia,' by which the J udices
Selecti were made eligible 'from the Senators, Equites, 'and Tribuni Aet-arii.
Horaee's father, as plain men are wont, looked up with reverence to the body
in whom were vested such high functione ; but the office was not an enviable
one, nor always most purely exercised. See C. iv. 9. 39, n. As to ‘ auctor-,²
see above, v. 80.

126. Avidos] This signifies ‘intemperate,' as in C. i. 18. 11.

129. Ex hoc ᾳιο sunus] Horace says that, owing to his father-’s training
(‘ex hoc’), he had been kept in a sound and healthy state, and preserved
from those vices which in their worst form bring destruction, but which in a
moderate degree may be overlooked. He implies thatin this venial form he

is liable to such faults3 but even from this smaller measure, time, the candor.

of friends, and reflection will deduct a good deal. Τ he sentence is a little

megum, but sufficiently intelligible. ‘ Consilium pmprinm’ is the counsel .

a man takes with himself when he reviews his life, and is bent upon correct-
· ing the errors of it. This sort of reflection a man may pursue, if he be in
earnest, either as he lies on his bed (see below, S. 6. 122, n.), or as he walks
abroad, alone among crowds. By ‘porticus' Horace means any one of the
public porticoes, covered walks, of which there were many at Rome, and
which were usually crowded by persons of all sorts, resorting thither for exen-
eise, conversation, or business,

137. olim] See C. ii. 10. 17, n.

139. Illudo chartis] This means, ‘I put it down in my notes by way of
amusement! As to ‘chartae‚’ see S. ii. 3. 2, n.

141. blatta poctarum veniat vnamts] Horace, in winding up his disc-ourse,
stops the lips of his opponente with a sally of good humor, which ‘hey would
find it hard to resist. He sayS, if they will not make excuses for this little
sin of his (that of taking notes of his neighbors' vices), he will bring a host
of sinners (poets) as bad as himself, and, like the proselytizing Jews (S. 9.
69, n.), they will attack thern till-they lnwe made convcrts and poets of them
all. ‘ Plures ' signifles any number more than one, as in Epp. i. 5. 28, “ Lo-
gus‘dSt et pluribus umbris.'’ ‘ Multo plures sumus ³ means ‘ there are many

SATIRE V.

In the spring of the year n. c. 37, Μ. Antonius brought over an army to
Italy, and a ficet of 300 ships (Plut. Ant. c. 35): ἔκ τινων διαβόλων παρο-
ξυνθεὶς πρὸς Καίσαρα, says Plutarch. He pretended, Dion says, to come
for the purpose of helping to put down Sextus Pompeius, his real object being

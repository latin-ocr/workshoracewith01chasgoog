features was the license granted, for the one day that the feast lasted, to

7. calami,] The reed used by the Romans for writing appears to have
been precisely the same as the ‘ kulum ’ now used throughout the East. Like
the papyrus, it was chiefly brought from Egypt, and, when cut aud ready for
use, differed scarcely at all from the pens we employ. As the bad workmau
finds fault with his tooIS, the poet is supposed to get iu a passion with his

‚peu and beet the wall by his bedside, because his ideas would not flow fast
enough. He who was unfortunate was said to have been born when the gods

tiou of ‘quo versum,’ ‘ to what point turned or tending! Plato was a eomie
writer, and a rival of Aristophanes, As to Eupolis, see S. i. 4. 1, n.‚ and for
Archilochus, see Epod. vi. 13, n.

13. vir-mee relicta ?] Ι have more than once had occasion to mmai-k, that
the notion of persever-aneo is involved in the Roman ‘ virtus ’ (see C. S. 59),
and it. is so here, being opposed to ‘ desidia ' (v. 15). But it means more, for
it implies moral eoumge and a strong will, which were in great esteem among
the Romans, Damasippus supposes the poet ω be oonsulting his ease and
his eowardice at the same time; and say-³, if he thinks to silence jealousy by
eeasing to write, he will only find himself the object of contempt3 and if he
mean-s to be idle now, he must be content to lose the reputation won in his
better days of enei-gy. As to Siren, 'see Epp. i. 2. 23.

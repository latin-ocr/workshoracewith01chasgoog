, ' 9. Ροὲίᾳιιάηιήἱλίῖ ὑπὸ· uirumque chamin] ‘When they found they could
not settle their quarrel privately, they went before the praetor (v. 18). The
digression that intervenes is a comparison between such disputante and the
warriors of the Iliad. When men fall out, says he, they flght aster the fashion
of two brave heroes engaged in a deadly feud, even as Hector and Achilles,
who hated each other so mortally, and were so exceedingly brave, that they
could not be separated when they came together in conflict till one or other
was killed ; or else they behave as when two cowards meet, and both are glad
to give way ; or as when the strong meets the weak; Diome'd meets GlaueuS,
and the weak gives in, and humbles himself before his enemy. -

ll. inter Hectora—atque inter Achillem] This repetition of ‘inter' is not
nncommon. See Cic. Lael. e. 25: “ Confio— judicare solet quid intersit
inter popularem civem, et inter constantem, severum, et gravem? See Eppz
i. 2. ll. ‘Animosum’ belongs to ‘Achillem‚' ‘atque' being often put by
Horace after the first word of its clause. See Epod. xvii. 4. S. i. 5. 43

15. vexet] The meeting between Glaucus and Diomed, in which the former
loses heart and gives up his arms to his adversm, is related in Hom. 11. vi.
234, sq . On ‘ultro,' see C. iv. 4. 51, n.

18. ruffo praetore tenente] Brutus was ‘ praetor urbanus ’ in the year Β. c.
214, when Caesar was killed ; and in the course of the same year he left Rome
for the purpose of taking possession, as propraetor‚ of the two provinces of
Macedonia and Bithynia, which had been assigned him by the senate, who
revoked his appointment before he had reached his province, and assigned it
to M. Antonius, and he made it over to his brother Citius. Brutus, however,
in deflanee of the senate, took possession of the province of Macedonia, and:
retained it after the formation of the coalition between Augustus and M. Ans
tonius. Being then at war with the senate, he led his troops into Asia Minor
as into a foreign country, and overran Lycia, and dealt with Asia as his own

Asia, which had ,never been assigned him. He called himself at this time
‘ imperator‚' as appears from coins still existing.

20. Compositum melius cum Bitho Bacchius] ‘ Composimm’ agrees with
‘ par ' understood, that word being used as a substantive for ‘ a pair,' both in
the singular, as here, and the plural, as Cic. Lael. c. 4 : “ Ex omnibus seculis
vix tria aut quattuor nominantur paria amicorum.'’ Bithus and Bacchius
are said to have been gladiatore of great repnte, who, after having in their
tSime killed many antagonistas, finally killed each other. As to ‘in jus: see
ι 22. ridetur ab omni Convertit ,·] ‘ Ridetur’ is used impersonally. , ‘ Conven-
tus ' was a meeting, at fixed times and places, of the inhabitants of a province
before the praetor or governor, for the purpose of settling disputes and trans-
acting business. The name was also applied to certain districts out of which
such meetings were eomposed.

23. laudatque cohortem .·] The official staff of a provincial governor was
called his ‘ cohors' and ‘comites’ See Epp. i. 3. 6 3 8. 2, 14. The lower
officials, who did not belong to the ‘ cohors,' but were a good deal about the
person of the governor, Cicero s eaks of as those “ qui quasi ex cohorte prae·
toris appellari solent '' ί Ad Qu. r. 1. i. Ep. 1. e. 4, where sce Long’s note).

to the present da in the word ‘ count.’

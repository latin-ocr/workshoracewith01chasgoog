255. Claustraque custodem pacis cohibentia] That which is commonl called
the Temple of Jauus was a passage enclosed between two xgates lea ing out
of the· city. A statue of -Janus was placed there, and from this and the two
- the· lace was called Janus Geminus, It was built, according to >tra-
dition, b uma (Livy i. 19). The gates were open in war and-closed in
peace. oraceis'explanation is, that the gates were shut during peace to pre·
*vent its guardian from leaving the city. The first time the gates were shut
during the Republic was B. c. 235. By Augustus they were closed three
timos (see C. iv. 15. 9, ιι), after the battle of Actium and taking· of Alexan-
dria, A. π. c. 725, and after the Cantabriau war, A. U. c. 729. The third
occasion is not known.

262. Discit- ' citius] ‘ Quis' belongs both to ‘discit' and to ‘deridet.’
Horace says men are more apt to remember what is ridiculous than that
which is good and serious; and therefore it is not pleasant to have one's
name associated with silly verses or an ugly wax image, such as the admirers
of public men might think to honor them with. Busts of litet-ary and other
distinguished men were put up in the public librat-ies (see S. i. 4. 21, ιι), and
were probably multiplied for sale. They were sometimes made of wax, of
-zvliich material were made the family busts preserved in the atria of private

ouses,

268. capsaporrertus αμα-ιφ] 'As to ‘capsa‚' see the note last resen-ed to,
Horace speaks of being stretched out in an open box as if he were a eorpse
being carried on a ‘vilis area' (S. i. 8. 9, n.) to the common burial-gmund,
that ie, to the groeer's shop. ‘ Vicum’ may mean the ‘ Vicus Thurarius,’
which was a part of the Vicus Tuscus mentioned S. ii. 3. 228. ‘Porrect'us '
is used commonly for corpses, ‘Aperta’ keeps up the notion of a ‘sanda-

ila‚' or common bier, on which the poor were can-ied out to burial. In plain
hinguage, Horace says he might expect his panegyrist's verses to be carried
to the grocer (to whom and the trunk-makcr waste paper goes still), and him-
self to be held up to ridicule with the author. .

 

EPISTLE ·11.

'Tms Epistle is addressed to Julius Florus, to whom also the· third of the
first Book was written. (See Introduction.) Its professed purpose is to
excuse Horace for not having sent Florus any verses. He sads be had
warned him before he went that he should not be able to write3 at he had

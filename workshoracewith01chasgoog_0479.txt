SATIRE ‚111.

Tms Satire appears to have 'been written during the Saturnalia, in the
mouth of December, B. c. 32. The year before, Agrippa had been AEdile‚
and his aedileship is alluded to inv. 185. It was written at Horace’s coun-
try-house. not long, it may he supposed, after it was given him. He was
improvin the house at the time, as we ma infer from v. 308. The Satire
is genera ‚ taking in the leading vices and ollies of human nature,—ambi.·
tion, avarice, extravagance, lust, superstition, which are brought together with
some in nuitv. ·

One Damasippus, a man who had wasted a good fortune in speculating as
an amateur in all sorts of eostly articleS, particularly works of art, in which
he was held to be a con-noisseur, is introduced in a new character, as a Stoic
philosopher, repr-oving Horace for his laziness‚ and urging him to write. He -
relates the story of his'own conversion to philosophy, which was this. When
he had lost all his fortune. and was hopelessly involved with money-lenders,
and found himself laughed at and called madman wherever he went, he grew

desperate, and was going to throw himself into the Tiber, when he was ar-
rested b StertiniuS, an oracle of the Stoics‚ who remonstrated with him and
2consol him, and at the same time armed him against his -enemies (v. 297)
with a long homily, in the course of which he proved that all the world, but
‘the good aud wisc, were as mad as he was. In this discourse he enumerates
¹ the chief feam-es of this universal matinensi, and this forms the bulk of the
Satire. ' . -
- of Damasippus ve little is known.. But he was a real person, though
perhaps a little before orace’s clay. Why ‚Horace should have chosen this
·man as the'mouth·piece of his Satire does not appear. Damasippus says
himself, itis true, that, having ruined his own affairS‚'he had nothing to do
' but to attend to the affairs of others; which Horace interprets to mean, that
he had taken to giving advice when it was not asked (see v. 27, n.). ’,

Stertinius appears to have been an authority among the Stoies of the day.
The Scholiasts tell us he wrote 220 books on the doctrines of that school.

'Damasippus calls him (v. 296) “sapientum octavus.” His books, if he ever
wrote them, have not rescued him from oblivion. Horace mentions him
again, in Epp. i. 12. 20, as the representative of the sect.

The discourse of Stertinius turns upon this dogma, that every man in the
world, high or low, is mad, except the sage (see note on v. 46). Cicero has

argued the same doctrine of the Stoics in his Paradoxa (iii. ὅτι πᾶς· ι’ίφρων
μαίνεται), but he does·not go very deep into the subject, or throw much light

upon it.

2. Mmbranam poscas] Horace speaks of parchment (‘ membrana ') only
twice (A. Ρ. 389), ‘charta,' wl'ich means the Egyptian papyrus, being his
usual equivalcnt sor a book. From the thin coats of the papyrus the name
‘ liber' was derived, and parchment was less generally used in Horace's day
than the papyrus ; though that material was also commonly employed.
‘ Texere chartam ' is a common expression for putting the pieees of the
papyrus together. ‘Retexere scripta,' therefore, means to take to pieces or
tear up what is written, or to take out leaves and substitute others, with dis-2

ferent writings upon them.

270. Plautinos et numeros d laudavere sales .·] See Ep . ii. 1. 170, ιι.
‘But, you will say, your fathers praised Plautus both for llis numbers and
his wit. YeS, they admit-ed too patiently, not to say stupidly, both the one
and the other.’ Horace never has a good word to say for Plautus, and he here
depreciatcs his wit as well as his versification. Both no doubt wanted polish3
and Horace does not scruplc to insinuate (ιιι the above place) that it was
only through haste to get paid that he turned out‘ his works so unfinished.
But his style and his defeets were incidental to the period and manner of his
life; his simplicity and drollery were given him by nature. lf Horace did

not admira Plautu3‚ more learned men did, and Varro was one of them, and

Cicero another.

275. Iynotmn trayicae] The first representation of a play at Thespis was ’

in B. c. 535. The name τρα ῳδία belonged, as observcd above (on v. 220),
to the dithyrambic songs of e Bacchic festivals, and these are of uncertain
origin. but of great antiquity. The extent to which Thespis can be consid·
ered the author of tragcdy is, that he introduced an actor independent of the
chorus, who sustained various parts under the disguisc of a linen mask. (See
v. 192 ιι.) This account, therefore, of the invention of tragedi.⁷ at the vint-
age, tine faces smeared with lec-s of wine, the wagon.with which Thespis
went round Attica, and so forth, may be rejected.

278. Post hunc personae pallaeque] Horace makes AEschylus the inventor
of the mask and tragic dress (v. 215, n.). But there can be no doubt that
he who first put an actor upon the stage, if he, as most suppose, gave him
van‘ous parts to sustain, mus-t have employed masks suited to the different
characters. There were symbolical masks for different ages and classes, and
there were descriptive masks for different persons, representing peculiarities
by which they would bc known. The derivation of persona’ is unknown.
Roscius first introduced masks on the Roman stage about Β. c. 100. T ho
garment Horace means by ‘palla' was an upper mese, which had a train

to it (see v. 215, n.).· For the proper meaning of ‘ palla,' see S. i. 8. 23, ιι. ·

As to ‘ pulpita ’ and ‘ cothurnuS,’ see Epp. ii. 1. 174, ιι. AEschylus may have
made improvements in what is called among ns the property of a theatro,
but there is no reason to suppose that he invented any of the above things,
‘ Magnum loqui ' means that he taught the actor how to articulate loudly.

281. Successit vetas his comoedia,] Horace takes no account of the earliest
form of eomedy, from which its name is derived, the song of the revellers
(κῶμος) at the Dionysia3 or os-the labors of Susarion, who as carl at least
as ThespiS, at Icaria, a village in Attica, -contendcd with a ‘c'omic c orus for
a prize. That which was before composed ofjests and obscenities connected
with the worship of Bacchus had now added to it persona} ribam· ’ and po-
litical jokeS, the former levellcd at the spectator-s or against public men.
Between Susarion and the period of the old eomedy there were several distin·
guishcd· writers, as Chionides, Magnes, EcpliantineS‚ and others. The earli-
est writer of the old eomedy was Cratinus. See S. i. 4. 1, n.

288. Vel qui praetextas] ‘Fabulae praetexta& or ‘ praetextatae.' were
tragedieS, as ‘togatae' were eomedieS, w'ith plots connected with Roman
stoi-ies and mannerS. (See Epp. ii. 1. 57, sqq.) The Greek tragedies to
which ‘ praetextae ' were opposed, were called by the Romans ‘ crepidatae.’

‘ Docere ' is used as the Greeks used διδάσκειν, for exhibiting a play, because '

the poet also trained the chorus as χοροδιδάσκαλος.

oon two, Hippocrene and Aganippe.

26. Phil· pis] See C. ii. ⁷. 9. ¹ .

28. Nec &teuta Palinurus unda] Horace's esca fmm shipwreek off Cape ⁴
Palinurus is nowhere else related3 and it is oubtful when it happened.
‘ Sicula unda ³ for the Tuscau Sea is an unusual limitation. It must not be
eonfounded with Mare Siculum, which was on the other side of Sicily.
Ξαξηῖξηιε was on the western coast of Lucania. It retains its name as Capo

32. Lictoris Assyrii] The Syl-ian eoast. See note on C. ii. 11. 16.

33. Visam Britannos] The stories of the human sacrifices of the ancient
Britons are too authentis to bedoubted. See Tacitus (Ann. xiv. 30). Virgil
(Georg. iii. 463> relaxes of the Geloni (C. i. 19. 10), that they used to eat
cheese dipped in horse's blood. Whether the Concani, who were a Can-

40. Pien‘w recreatis anem] SuetoniuS, in his Life of Augustus (84, 85),
relates that he followed litera pul-suits with great zeni, and dabbled in

, 41. Vos bem eonsilium] The nultimate vowel coalesces with the next,
as in ‘principium ⁹ (ili. 6. 6), ‘ lfenius' (S. i. 3. 130), ‘ Nasidieni ’ (S. ii. 8.
1). So Virgil says (Aen. i. 73): “Connubio jungam stabili.’' ‘Ye give

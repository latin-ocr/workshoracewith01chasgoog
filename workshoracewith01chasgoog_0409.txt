hmd. The beasts do not war upon their kind. Is it madness, or soree irre-
sistible, or wickedneSS‚ that drives you-‘3 They are dumb: they answer not.
³T is even so: the blood of Remus is vlsited on the destmies of Rome.

2. conditi 5] Swords which were ‘ lately sheathed.'
7. Intactas] See C. iii. 24. 1. What Horace means to say is, “ Τὴρ blood

-that has been spilt in these civil wars has been shed, not for the destruction

of carthag-e, as in the war that Scipio led, or that the Briton might be led in

chains, as he was by Julius Coesar, but for the destruction of- Rome herself.''

12. ἄκραν] This signifies an, animal of another species. ‘Feris,’ agree-

13. vis acriam] This seems to be an absolute expression (not comparative
with ‘ furor ’)‚ and equivalent to θεοῦ βία, θεοβλάβειας and it is so ex lained
by Gaius with refeience to such a visitation of God as a storm, ea quake,

vim divinam appellant, non debet conductori damnosa esse.'’ Horace means
some irresistible force. ¹

the fight. .Io Triumphe! bring forth the golden chariot and the sacrifice.
So great a conqueror never came from Africa before. The enemy hath ·
changed his purple for mourning, and hath fled to Crete or the Syrtes, or
knoweth not whither to fly. Bigger cups, hoy, - Chian, or Lesbiam, or Cae-
euban,- we will drown our old anxieties for Caesar in wine.

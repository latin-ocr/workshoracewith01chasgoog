ODE XIII.

Tms Ode expresses a lover's jealonsy, being addressed to his mistres8,
Lydia, who is supposed to be coquetting with a youth named Telephus.

τ Α’Βθσκιιιιῐτ. -- Lydia, while thou art praising Telephus's neck, Telephus's
anne, oh! my beart is ready to burst. My mind tosses about3 m color
comes and goes ; and the tear stealing down m cheek tells of the s ow fire
that burns within. It galls me when his rough ands hui-t thy shoulders, or
his teeth leave their mark on thy lips: think not he will be constant who
'could hurt that nectared mouth. How happy they whom love binds fast, to
the day of their death! .

’ 2. cerea Telephi] ‘ Cerea' means ‘white as wax! The Romans wore
then-'necks and arms bare, the tunic being cut so as to expose the throat and

16. Quinta parte sui nectaris imbuet] Some of the Greek poets had notione.

Dumna the troubles in Mitylene, his native city, Alcaeus wrote an Ode,
of which this seems to be a close imitation. It was written most probably·
· during the civil warS, that is, between nc. 41 and 30 (when Horace returned
to Rome). The state is likened to a ship drifting out to sea with its 'rigging
crippled‚ and in danger of destruction.

Anounmrr. - Thou art drifting- again to sea, thou ship; oh! haste, and
make for the harbor; oars lost, mast epist, yards crippled, and riaging gone,
how canst thou weather the storm ’ἕ Thy sails are torn, thy gods ane gone,
and, noble hull though thou be, there is no strength in thy beauty. If thou
be not fated to destruction, avoid the tocke, thou who wert butlate my grief,
and art now my anxious care.

6. sinefimibusl ‘deprived of het-,riggingss Some understand it to mean
‘without girding ropes,' referring to St. Lnke's description of their under-
girding the ship in which St. Paul was being conveyed to Rome (Acts
xxvii. 16 .

10. Νο)η dag] “ Acci it et pictos puppis {danea deos ’' (Ov. Hei-oid. xvi.
· 112). There was usua ly a niobe in the stem of a. ship where the image of ‘
the tutelary god was kept.

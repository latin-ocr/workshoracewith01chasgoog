,beginning of the year B. c. 38, and this satire was written n. c. 30.

42. quem tollere rheda] ‘ Rhoda ’ is the name for a travelling-carriage. The
shape probably varied, but it appears to have gone upon four wheels, and to
have been, sometimes at least, of capas-iaus size, since Juvenal mentions a
whole family travelling in one ‘rheda' (S. iii. 10). The onl other four-
wheeled -carriage we read of, is the ‘petorritum,' mentioned a ve (S. i. 6.
104, n.). There were public ‘rhedae on the great roadS, for the benefit os
travellers‚ and Horace and his friends performed part of their jouruey to
Brundusium in these conveyances (S. i. 5. 86), and it appears from his lan·

were three different kinds of gladiators. The first had their name from being
armed like the ThracianS, with a short sword and round shield‚ from which
they were sometimes called ‘ parmularii.' Gallina was one of these, Syrus
was probably one of another sort. Maecenas is supposed to -ask Horace,

. among other trifling questions, whether h'e has seen the famous gladiatore,
· and which is the better of the two.

45. mordent ‚·] ‘ Mordere' is said of both heat and cold. See Ε p. i. 8.

construction of the next sentence, see S. i. 1. 45. ⁸ Luserat' refers to ball-
.play. ‘ Fortunae filius ’ was a conventional phrase. Sophocles uses it (Oed.
’ 5Tyr. 1080), ἐγὼ δ’ ἐμαυτὸν παῖδα τῆς τύχης νέμων.

. 50. Γνιζιιίιὶαεα Rostris? Suppose some bad news has been published in the
Forum and been circu ated in the streets. The ‘ rostra,' which Niebuhr
(i. 406, n.) describes as “a stage of considerable, length, with steps at each
end of it,’' originally separated the comitium, wh'ere the patricians met, from
the space where the plebeian assemblies were held, which was roperly the
Forum, though that name was populat-ly applied to the whole. ere persons
of all ranks met, and from this centre repon-ts would naturally take their rise',
and then get disseminated in the city. The ‘rostra' had its plural name
from the beaks of vessels taken from the people of Antium (Liv. viii. 14),
‘with which the stage was ornamented. As to the ‘compita‚' see note on S.
ii. 3. 25. .

to Italy, were discontented, and broke out into mutiny because they had no
reward. Augustus came from Asia to quell this mutiny, and gave money to
some of the soldiers‚ and to others he distributed lands in those parts that had
been favorable to Antonius. ‘ Triquetra ' signifies triangular, and is a name
for the island of Sicily, called also Trinacria, from its three promontories.
Caesar describes Britain also as “insula triquetra ”- (Β. G. v. 13).

57. unum Scilicet—mortalem] The Greeks use εἷς ἀνῆρ in this way, to
express a superlative. .

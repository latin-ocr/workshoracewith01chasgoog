-ODE XI.

'rius Ode is addressed to one Hirpinus, who, if a real person, is ‚quite un-
known. The poet bids him cease to trouble himself about distant nationS,
and put away care, since old age is approaching.

Aaouusnr. —Never mind what distant nations are about, nor trouble
thyself for the wants of life, which needs but little: youth is going, and age
approaching: the flowers aud the moon are not always bright: why worry
thyself for ever (ζ Let us drink under the shade of yonder tree. Mix wine,
boy, and bring Lyde to sing to us.

l. Quid bellicosus} As to the Cantabri, see above, 6. 2, and for the Scythiam,

6. Levis] ‘ smooth,’ ‘ beardless.’

10. rubens] This word is not commonly used to ex ress the brilliancy of

spring (Viig. Geoig. iv. 306).

Horace uses ‘ S 'o ' for an Indian commodity (above, C. 7. 8), “ Malobathro
Syrio ''; and ‘ ssyrii ’ for the coast of Syria (C iii. 4. 32), and ‘Assyrius '
for any Eastern person (A. R. 118), “ Colchus an Assyrius? This confusion

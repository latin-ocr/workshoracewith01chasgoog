“Tbere is no book in the English language which will make a
more delightful companiou than this. ..... We have few criti-
cisms to make upon this volume, which must not only be read,
but possessed, in order to be adequately valued.”

NEW YORK INDEPENDENT.

“ ..... Among all the books of this new era of elegance‚ two
have been on the whole distimstly the most beautiful, namely De
Tocqueville’s Democracy in Amerioe, and the present ‘ Golden
Troesuryss Both are better manufadtured books than England
can show: sor although it is true that the· materials sor both
were inpart imported, yet the dest touch of American finge‘ss,
the keen sig-ht and judgment and ‘faculty’ of Amerioen eye
and hrain, impart a finish and an algogtther (this is much better
than to καὶ ‘tout ensemble ' from the wicked Emperor) which
John Bull’s big, thumby fin ers can in no wise attain unto. We
recommend attention to e singularly clear and elegant cut
os the type, more particularly in the exquisite nonparenl of the
notes: the perse& clearness and evenness of the mess-work: the
workmanlike fiuish and tastesul design of the binding, ‘entirely
sim le, yet ornamenta! in the best sense : and the sharp delicac
in· esign and impressioni of the engrayed teil-pieces and hm -
preces. ’ ,

omis. — ΒοοΚ 1. 281

chapter of Judges, ver. 28 : “ The mother of Sis-era looked out at a window,
and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why
*arry the wheels of his chariot ’ἒ ” There are four objecta in respect of whic
Fortune is here said to be invoked, — the seasons, the winds, war, and fac-
tion. (See Introduction.) She is said to be an object of reverence to the
distant and barbarous nations, as well as the cities and revinces of the Ro-
man world, and Eastern mothers and tyrants fearing for eir crowns.

14. Stantem columnam] The figures of Peace, Security, HappineSS, and
others, are each represented on old monuments as restin on a column. What
Horace means ie, that tyrants are afraid lest Fortune s ould overthrow their
power, re resented fi rativel by a standing column.

15. A arma — a arma] he repetition of these words suggests the cry of
the ‘ thronggng people ’ (‘ frequens populu's ’). ‘ Cessantes ' means the peacea·

57. menum anteit saeva Necessitas] , The several things that Necessity is
here represented as holding, are emblems of tenacity and fixedness of purpose,
—--the nail‚ the clamp, and the molten lead: they have nothing to do with
tortere, as many have su sed. ‘ Anteit ' is to be scanned as a diss llable.

18. Clavos trabales] 'f e
beams in large houses. There is said to be one in the Museum of the Grand
Duke of Tuscany, at Florence, weighing fifty pounds, made of bronze. ‘ Clavi
trabales ' had passed into a proverb with the Romans. Compare Cicero (in
Verr. Act. ii. 5. 21) ε “ ut hoe beneficium, quemadmodum dicitur, trabali
clavo figeret.” ‘ Cunei ' were also nails wedge-shaped. On the nails of Fate,
see C. i1i. 24. 7. ’ The metaphor of molten lead, used for strengthening build-
ingag8 used by Euripides (Androm. 267), καὶ γὰρ εἶ πέριξ σ·’ ἔχει nyx-rtis·

v 05· o
μόέΙ. Te Spes et albo] The picture represented in this and the followi
stanzaS, a rt from the alleg-cry, is that of a rich man in adversity, going fort
from his ome, with hope in his breast, and accompanied by a few faithful
friendS, but deserted by those who onl cared for his wealth. In the person
of Fortune‚ therefore, is re iescnted e man who is suffering from her re-
vel-ses ; and in that of Fide ‘ty, the small (‘ rara ') company of his true friends,-
Fortune is re resented in the garments of mourning (‘ mutata veste ’), and
Fides in a w ite veil, emblematie of her purity. With such a veil on their
heads, men offered sacrifice to her. She is called by Virgil (Aen. i. 292),
‘ Cana Fides: but there it probably means ‘ aged.’ According to Livy (i. 21),
Numa established religious rites for Fides.

22. nec comitem abneqat,] ‘ nor refuses herself for thy companion,’ as if ‘ se ⁸
were understood. .

28. Fer-rejuyum pariter dolosi. ‘ Τοο fm‘thless to bear the yoke together
with him.’ This metaphor is ta en from beasts unequally yoked.

29. Serves iturum] See Introduction.

· ultimos Orbis Britannos] “ Et penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos ’' (Virg.
13⁰⁶, i. 67), “Extremique hominum Morini ” (Aen. viii. 727), are like Hor·
8⁰23?aean rubra] The force that was to conquer Arabia (see C. i. 29)
was probablyat this tune preparmg.

36. unde] ‘ From what? . ¹

39. diffugias retusum} ‘ Diffin s’ is a word met with in no author but
Horace, who uses it here and in . iii. 29. 47 : “ neque Diffinget infectumque
reddet.'' It means here to break up or unmake, with the purpose of forging
it again. ‘ O I pray thee on new anvil recast the blunted sword, for the
Scythian and the Arab.’ It had been blunted in civil war, and was to be
whetted again for the destruction of the barbarians. ·

40. Mamqaas] These*people are said by Herodotus (i. 204) to have in·

se were nails of the largest sort, for astening ·

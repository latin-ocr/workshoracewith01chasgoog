probably about the same time, on the return of Augustus to Rome, n. c. 132

All that is here said of the subjectioni of the world and the universal peace

was said in effect at the close of the sourteenth Ode ; but it was natural that.

if Horace had received the emperor's commands to publish another book ol

Odes, he should conclude it with one addi-essed to Augustus himself, review·

grzgsglggepggisffigevpisclilis reign, niliich at this fiissssllilff ‘peon crowned by a series

Artemis-sr— When Ι would sing of ποτε, Phoebus checked me with his
lyre. Thy reign, Ο Caesar, hath brought back our lost honor, with plenty
and peace and order, and the means by which our name- and strength have
become reat. Under th protectioni we sear no wars, at home or abi-oud:
the Nort and the East ο y thy laws, and we with our wit es and children
will sing of the heroes of old, of Troy, and Anchises, and os Venus's son. ·

· ²· ‘maer {zrafzx‹¹.:zz.3etfz.÷.e ’κη’ 2-
Movit inauratae pollice fila lyrae.’'
‘Increpuit lyra’ therefore signifies ‘cheeked me by touching the stringen!
his lyre, and leading me to a strain' more litted to my muse! The other met-²
:ilphor¹ is comaron enough. See Virgil (Geor-g. ii. 41 l: ‘⁴ Pelagoque velana
a ve a utenti. '

4. Τιιξέ, chaat, arras] The abruptness with which this is introduced is
worth remarking. A longer prefaee would have weakened the Ode.

5. Fruyes et σφῆς, This is a repetition of C. iv. 5. 17, sq.

6. nostm— Jove] To the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus.
· 7. Dempta] As the standai-ds were quietly and voluntaril sent to Augus*
tus-hy Phraates, Horaee's language is romewhat emerget-tuci The recovery

(sce C. iii. 5, Introd.) of the standards lost by Crassus was one of the greatest ’
causes of rejoicmg‘that ever ha pencd at Rome. Without it, the restoration >

effected by Augustae, and of w iich Horat-e here gives a compendious picture,
would have been wanting in one of its. chief features; the honor, as well ns
the peace, of Rome was restored. These praises are repeated from or in (for
we cannot say which was written first) Epp. ii. 1. 251, sqq. See also Epp. i.

9. Janum Quirini] If ’Janum Quiiim’ and not ‘Janum Quirinum ' be
the true reading, Horace assir-*ns to ‚Romulus the building of the temple ot*

¹ Janus, which is usually assigned to Numa. 'The other would mean ‘Janus

called QuirinuS‚’ a name given him as «Ianus of the Quirites. As to the shut·
ting of the tem le, see Epp. ii l. 255, n.

10 anelanti This nowhere else appears with an accusative case, but
‘ evadere ⁹ and ⁸ exire ⁸ ane used with an accusative repeatcdly (Com are C.
. iii. 24. 29.) ‘Artes' means those-virtues in which the discipline o life is
placed, as prudcnee, justice, fortitude, and temporanee.

17. fier-or Civilis aut vis] ‘Civilis’ belongs to ‘furor,’ and ‘vis,’ which is
a technieal word, means here ‘ personui violence! ⁴ Ira’ applies to foreign
quarrelS. See C. iii. 14. 14, n.

20. inimicat] This is another word which Horace probably found in use
by.writers of a former day. Later writers have taken it from him. It means
;.⁸‘·'¹³d⁸.¹³ erluinity! ‘ Appreeati ’ (v. 28), ‘ remixto ⁹ (v. 30), are also words first

oun in eruce.

21. qui preliandum Danubium bibunt] The⁴ German tribes, particularly the
Vindelici lately subdued. ‘ Edicta Julia' ean only mean here the laws of
Augustus, laid upon them at their conquest, though in its technical sense the
word ‘edicta’ would not apply. The rules of a governor published in his
province were his ‘ edictum,. and these people were not in a province. Hor·-

pigaclffigkcipium] This word, which properly significa the act of taking pos·
sessiou, ‘ manu capiend0,’ is applied here ιο the ‘res mancipi,' the object of

‘mancipium‚' which, iu this instance, is a slave. It is so used in Epp. i. 6. “

82). As ιο t e Saturnalia, see S. 3. 5, n. The month of December wau

q 6. Pars hominum] Davus avails himself, without preface, of his master’s
permission, and begins to moralize on the instability of some men, who never
know their own minds. This character he applies ιο his master in v. 23, sqq.

9. Cum tribus annellis,] This is mentioned as a large number. In later
times the Romans wore a great profusiori of rings on both hands. At this
time they were only worn on the left, because they were more likely to be in·
jared, and to be in the way, on the right hand. Priscus was a senator, and
therefore entitled ιο wear a gold ring, which privilege did *not descend, at this
time, below the equestrian order. In later times it was conferi-ed upon all'
manner of persons by the emperors'. These who were not entitled to wear
rings of gold had them of iron, according to the most ancient practice3 and
such of the Romans of higher condition as adhered to the simplicity of earlier
days continued to wear iron. - ' ’

Priscus, as a senator, was entitled to go abroad with the ‘latus-clavus,'
which he would do sometimesg while at others he would appear only as an
‘eques,’ with the ‘angustus clavus? He was rich enough to live in a fine
house, and did so; but would from caprice go and take an obscure lodging‚
such as a poor-man might be ashamed of. He put on first one character and
then another: now a man about town, and now talking ·of going to Athens
as a philosopher.. He was just such an unstable person as Tigellius is de·
scribed to be, in S. i. 3. 18: “Nil fuit unquam Sic impar sibi.'' He was
“ cverything by turnS, and nothing long.’' . ’

·14. Vertumnis„ quotquot sunt, natus iniquia] VertumnuS, as his name indi-
cates, was the god. who. represented change. Horace says Priscus was born
when Vertumnus was angry (see S. 3. 8, n., “Iratis ¹natus paries dis atque
pthis ²³), and he strengthens it by saying, ‘ all the Vertumni that are to be
found ’; as if every image *of the god were a separate divinity, and all were
angry together, when this fickle man was born. “

15. Scurra Vdanerius] Nothing is known of this person. He had the
gout, which Horace says he richly deser-ved, and was so given to gambling
(which was illegal, see C. iii. 24. 58, n.), that, when he could not handle the
dice-box himself, he hired a boy to do it for him. ‘ Phimus ’ was the Greek ·
word for what the Romans called ‘fritillua' From the shape it> was also·
called ‘turricula’ or ‘pyrgus' (πύργος). As to ‘talos‚’ see S. 3. 171, n.
They were not always thrown from a box, but sometimes with the hand.

19. levina miser ac priorillm] ‘ Levius miser’ is an unusual expression.
‘Prior iuo ' means better off than that man who is always changing his
character, one moment appearing strict, another loosc, in his principles and
conduct. The superiority of the man, who is consistent in vice lies in his
indifferenee to virtue, and the quietness of his conscience arising from that
cause. In that sense he is bettcr off, and less miserable, than the other.

21. Non dices hodie,]· ‘Hodie ’ is equivalent to ‘statim‚' ‘this moment.’
‘Furcifer ’ means a slave who for some slight offcuce was obli ed togo about
with a ‘ furca ' round his neck, a sort of collar shaped like a , in which the

92. conducto naviyv'o] ‘ Navigium' expresses the vulgar crast which the
poor man hires in imitation of the private yacht, as smartly-built and well
found as a trireme belonging to the rich man. He hires his boat, which he
cannot afford to do, and goes through the hon-ors of sea—sickneSS, that he may
have the honor of serving as a soil 10 1110 elegance of hia wealthy neighbor.

94. Si canutus inaequali tonsore] He goes on to tax Maecenas, good-hu-
moredly, with the prevailing inconsistency (94 - 105). ‘ Capillos curare ' was
a. common expression. Domitian wrote a book ‘ de cura ca illorum,' accord-
musi). 11111. 11111111
was the upper tunic. ⁸ Pexae’ significo a eloth of which the nap was not
closely shorn, and was still fresh. The upper tunic, therefore, would be new,
while the under one was old and shabby. The ⁴ subucula ' had deci-cs, .
which the ‘ intusium ' had not. An difference in the eloth, therefore, would ·
be very perceptible. Out of doors 1110 toga would conceal both, but in doors
the toga. was not worn. ‘ Intusium' is from ‘indu0.' ⁴ Subucula' is con-
nected with ‘duo' (that is, ‘do') likewise. ‘Disconvenit’ is a word only
found in Horace. It occurs a'gain, Epp. 14. 18.

the whole would be onl a joke against himself, or truth in jest, which Μω-
cenas would understan . He appears to have began building as soon as he
entered 011 his new property, if there is any meaning in the scolding be gets
from Damasippus (S. ii. 3. 307). .

102. nec curatoris eyere] See S. ii. 3. 217, 11. ⁶ Tutela' was the guardian· .
ship of a. ‘tutor,' the retector of an orphan's property till he came to the age
of puberty. ‘ Curate a ' was the office of ‘ curator,' who had the same rela-
tion to the orphan, in a modified form, till he was twenty-five (see above, v.
22, 11.). It was also that of the protector of insane persons. ‘ Tutela,' there-
fore, is not the precise word to keep up the previous notion. Horace means
that Maecenas looks after him anxiously, as if he was his ‘tutor,' and he
looks up to him as if he was his ‘pupillu3,' but that bis guardian had better
look to his greater fauste, and correct those‚-than be put out by trifling de-
fecta, such as negligence of diffisa, and so forth. What Horace sayS, is 2 re
etition in a different form of “ Ο et praesidium et dulce decus meum '² ( .
i. 1. 2 . · ·

105). respicientis] This word is much stronger than our term ‘ respect‚’
which is derived from it.

· 106. Ad summam :] This is an ordinary formula, ‘ to come to the point?
‘ to conclude! The pursuit of virtue and wisdom is the point from .which he
started, and, ,having digressed a little, he returns suddenly, and concludes
with a definition of the sage, which is a repetition of S. i. 3. 124, sqq. Here
it is added that he is the oniy freeman, and inferior to Jove alone. -

108. Praecipue sanus,] Horace says jocularlv, that the Stoic above 811 his
ether attributes is of course ‘sanuS‚ except when his digestionis disturbed
and the phlegm troublcsome3 ‘sanus’ bearing a double application to the
body (from the painsof which no exem tion was claimed for the Stoic suge,

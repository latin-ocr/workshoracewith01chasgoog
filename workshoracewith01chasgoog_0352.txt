· · Tne Ode is an address to a fountain about six miles from Venusia, which

has been identified with one still existing‚ but in a very different state, bare
of trees and choked up with dirt. We need only suppose that the name
was suggested to Horaee by the recollections of his ehildhood, without
imagining him really on the point of offering sacrifice, or being in the
neighborhood of his birthplace when he wrote. It has something of the-
natufie of an epigramma or inscription, and is among the choicest of Horaee's
sma preces. -

OD'E XIV.

Tms Ode was composed at the close of the Cantabrian war, n.c. 25,
when Augustus's return was expected, or on his return the following year.
He was detained· hy illness at Tarracona. The poet calls upon the citizens
to rejoiee‚ and bids the conqueror’s wife and sister go-forth to offer sacrifice,
deelaring that he too will keep holiday.

ARGUMENT. -- Caesar is returning a conqueror-from Spain, Ο ye people,
he who but just went forth like Hercules to the field. Let his ehaste wife
und sister go forth to offer sacrifice with the matrone, while the young soldiers
and their brides stand reverently by. I too will keep holiday; for I am
safe while Augustus is lon-d of the world. Bring flowers‚ boy, and ointmentg

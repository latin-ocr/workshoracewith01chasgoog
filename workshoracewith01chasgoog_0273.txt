1. Lmadabunt] This future is like ‘scriberis ' in the last Ode (v. 1),
‘ others shall if they plesse! ‘ Claram ' means ‘ brightss with reference to its·
cloudless skics. ·‘ Bimaris ' is an unusual word. It refers to the position
of Corinth, which, standing at the south of the isthmuS, commanded the
shore of the Sinus Corinthiacus», by two long walls reaching from the town
to the sea, and had its eastern port Cenchreaeon the Sinus SaronicuS.

5.. Sunt quibus] ‘ There are tlmse who make it the single business of their
lives to tell of chaste Minerva's city in unbrokeu song, and to guther a
branch from every oiive to entwine their brow.' A ‘ perpetuum carmen ’
is a continuous poem, such as an Epic; and ⁶ a branch from every olive,' or,
mone literally, an ‘ olive-branch from every quartcr,' means that the various
themes connected with the glory of Athens are as olive-trees, from each of
which a branch is pluckcd to bind the poet’s brow. The figure is appro-
priate to the localit *, where the olive flourishcd and was sacred to Minerva
(see Herod. v. 8. o h. Ocd. Col. 694, sq .). We do not know of any poem
or poems to which orace may have allu cd, but Athens furnished subjects
for the inferior poets of the da . -

8. Plurimus] This word lgr ‘plurimi ' standin alone occurs nowhere
else; with a substantive it is not uncommon, as ‘ (1 caster plurimu& Georg-
ii. 182. ‘Plurimus aeger‚' Juv. iii. 232. ‘In honooem,' for the ablativo,
is an unusual construction. But Propertius (iv. 6. 13) sayS, “ Caesaris iu
nomen ducuntur carmina,” which is au analogous case. See Hom. 11. ir.
51, where Here says :·-

Homer (11. ii. 287) caus Argos ἑππόβατον (⁴ aptum equis ³), the plain in
which the city was placed being famous for bmedinghorses.

‘ Diues Mycenas ’js later„- Μυκήνας τὰς πολυχρῦσυυς (Soph. Elect 9).
‘opimae Larissae ' is Homeric3 Λάρισσα ἐριβώλαξ (11. ii. 841). There
were several towns of this name, and it is uncertain which‘Homer meant,
but probably that in Thessaly. Κοκκω- perhaps took his town, with its
epithet, without thinking. much where it was. But he may have bccn at all
these places while he was in Grceee. ‘Patiens ' is the Spartan's historical
character, but also that of Horace’s age. Cicero (Tusc. v. 27) says, “ Pueri
Spartiatae non ingemiscunt verberum dolore laniati. Adolescentium greg-es
Lacedaemone vidimus ipsi, incredibili contentione certantes pugnis, calcibus,
unguibus, morsu denique, ut exanimarentur prius quam se victos faterentur.”
‘ Percussit ’ is generally used with the ablative of the instrument or cause.
Standing alone in this way, and in the aoristie perfect, it savors very much of
ἔπληξε, which is used in the same sense. .

12. Albuneae resonantis] Albunea, one of the Sibyls worshipped at Tibur,
gave her name to a grove and sountain. See Vix-g. Aen. vii. 81, sqq.

13. Tiburni lucus! Tiburnus (or ·tus), Catinae, and Coras were the mythi-
eal founders of Tibur. See vim. Aen vii. 1571. The brothers were wor-

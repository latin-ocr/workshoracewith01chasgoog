19. licebit This use of the future tense shows that ‘ licet ' and some other
words, whie are called by the grammat-iaus eonjunefions, are in fact only

EPODE XVI.

Tms Ode is written with great care, and was probably one of those eom-
positione by which Horace brought himself into public notice. ‘It has more
the appearance οἳ having been written for fame than any other in the book:
- Probably it was written at the outbreak of the Perusian war, Β. c. 41. Hor-
ace mourns over the civil wem, and proposes that all good citizens shall mi-
grate to the Fortunate Islands.

Auen-nuum. — Another age is wasting in civil wars. She whom no enemy
could tame, shall be destroyed hy her own accurscd children ; the wild beast
shall devonr her; the barbarian shall trample upon her, and scatter the dust
of her Romulus to the winds.

3. Marsi] This refers to the Social War. mentioned in C iii. 14. 18.

4. Parmae] The penultimate syllable of this name is usually long, hut it
is here short. Porsena was king of Clusium, in Etruria. He espoused the
cause of Tarquinius SuperbuS, and attaeked Rome wi'th a large army. The ’
Roman legende of Coeles, who defended the bridge, of Cloelia, who with her
maidens swam over the river, and of Mucius Scaevola, who thrust his hand
into the fire. are all connected with this period. Though the Roman histori-
ans 'have thrown disguises over the fact, there is every reason to believe that

Porsena reduced the city to submission, and took from her all the territory
she had obtained north ἕξ the Tiber.

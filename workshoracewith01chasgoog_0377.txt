tribes, whose territet-ies were constituted a Roman province under the united
name of Raetiae, Raetia Prima or Proper, and Secunda, which embraced the
possessione of the Vindelici: these also comprised several other tribes, of
whom Horace articmarly mentions the Genauni and Breuni. The whole of
this war took pqace in the spring and summer of the year B. c. 15, and we, aue
led to suppose from C. iv. 14. 34 — 38, that it was brought to a conclusion in
the month of August, on the anniversary of the capture of Alexandria by
Augustus in the year 30 (C. i. 37, Introduction). In honor of these victories
Horace composed this Ode and the fourteenth of this booksphe one more

that this Ode was written immediately after the victory of DrusuS‚ while the
other was composed two years afterwardS, when Augustus returned to Rome.

Aneuunnr. — Like the young eaglc just darting on its prey, or the you
lion fresh from its dam, was Drusus when he met the rude Vindelici, an
made them feel what hearts could do trained under the eye of Augustus.
The brave give birth to the brave. The steer and the horse have the blood
of their sires, and the eagie gives not birth to the dove. But edueation brings

witness, and the day which saw Hasdrubal defeated, and drove the clouds and

from that day, and Hannibal was forced to cry, “As the deer might pursue

,· 1. Qualem] The epodosis of this long opening (which, however, gains
power as it proceeds) 1s to be found in the 'seventeenth verse. The best way
to render it will be by changing the cases in ‘ministrum' and ‘juventas't
‘ as the thunderbolt's winged minister one day by youth and native strength
from its nest is driven, and by the breezes of spring is ssuttering taught,' etc'.
Vi 'l calls the eaglc “Jovis armiger ’' (Aen. v. 255), which Pliny (N. H. x,
3, 4 says is his couventionai title.

2. aves myas] ‘ Vaga,' as an epithet applied to birds, cot-responde to the

Greek ἦε όφοιτος. Horace follows a legend later than Homer in the story of
Ganyme e (see C. iii. 20. 16).

5. Olim] See C. ii. 10. 17, n. ‘Propulit,' ‘docuere,' ‘demisit,’ ‘egit,’ are
used in an aoristic sense.

lion’s whelp, fresh from his tawny mother’s dugs, just weaned, -— she by his
young tooth soon to die! ο ·

18. quibus Mos unde] All we can gather from these verses ie, that the Vin-
delici carried some species of battle-axe, that the Romans had felt the weight
and edge of it, and that the Vindelici were counted a strange, wild race,
whose origin and history the Romans professed to know nothing about.

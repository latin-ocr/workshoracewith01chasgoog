ODE VI.

. Tun appointment of Horace to compose the principal Ode at'the Secular
Games, Β. c. 17, seems to have given him much pleasure, and to have given
his mind a new stimulus in favor of ode-writing. To the honor thus confer-
red upon¹ him we owe, perhaps as much as to Angustus’s hidding, this fourth
book, of thch the third, sixth, eighth, and ninth, all bear gnarks of the legiti-

the slaver of Achilles, and thereby having preserved AEneas to be the founder
of the Roman family ; and having pray'ed for and obtained the help of that
god for the task he is going to perform, Horace turne, as choraguS‚ to the

“ Ano nusum. -— Ο thou, the punisher of Niobe and TityoS, and the slayer
of Achilles, he who shook the walls of Troy was no match for thee, but fen
under thy strength as the pine-tree laid low by the axe, 'or the cypr-ess by. 'the
east wind. He would have taken Troy, not by guile bnt by cruel force, but
that Jove had granted AEneas to‘thv prayers and those of his dear VenuS. Ο

1 .· Diae] The pu se of the Ode being to invoke the assistance of Apollo
for the composition o the Secular Ode, the invocation is suspended here, and

ν not taken up again till the praises of the 'god have been sung, as the avenger
of crime and the destroyer of Achillea. '

proles Niobea] The number of Niobe's children is stated variously by dif-
ferent authore. The version best known is that which Achilles gives. to
'Pi-iam, when be 'is comforting him for Hector (Il. xxiv„ 602—617), that she
‘had six sons and as many daughter-S, and that, because she had boastfully
‘compared the number of her offspring with that of Lato’n, who had but *Arte-
-mis and Apollo, these two shot all her children, who were turned to stone by
Zeus. She was afterwards changed .to stone herself. Considerable remains

her 'ldren‚ exist in the Gallery at Florence. · .

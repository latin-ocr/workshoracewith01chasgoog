EPISTLE Ι.

Some time after Horace had published his three books of odes, and had,
as it appears, laid aside that sort of writing, it seems that Maecenas and
probably his other friends, begged him to return to it. That is the obvious
meaning of the remonstrance with which the Epistle opens. He expresses
an eamest wish to retirc into privacy, to abandon 'poetry,- and to devote him-
‘sels to tilae study of philosophy and virtue, which he recommends as th'e only
true wis om.

· 1. Prima dicte ηιίΙιί,1 This⁴ is an affectionate way of speaking. It has no
particular reference to anything Horace had written. Itis like Virgil’s ad-

dress to Pollio (Ec. viii. ll) : “ A te principium, tibi desinet. '’; or Neston’s-

to Agamemnon (ΙΙ. ix, 96) τ ,
·’ Ἀτρείδη κύδιστε, ἅναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγάμεμνον, ’

Ἐν σοὶ μὲν λήξω, σέο δ’ ἄρξομαι.
’ 2. Spectatum satis et donatum jam rude] When gladiatore received their
discharge, they were presented by the ‘lanista‚' or 'the ‘ editor spectaculo-
'rum‚’ who owned or hired them, with a ‘ rudis‚' which was a blunt wooden
instrument, some say a swerd, others a cudgel. The name may have be·

'longed to any weapon used in the ‘ praelusio,' or sham fight that generally τ

preceded the real battle with sharp swords. The gladiators thus discharged
'were called ‘rudiarii,’ and, if they were freemen, ‘exauctorati.’ ‘ Specta-
‘tum ’ is a technical term. Tickcts, with the letters SP upon them, were
given to gladiator-s who had distinguished themselves, ‘Ludus' means the
*pace where the mining took place, and the gladiators were kept. (See A.
. 32 n. ·
' 4. ’Veignius armis Herculis ad postem] Veianius was a ‘rudiariuS‚’ and
. when he was discharged, he hung up his weapons in the temple of Hercules,
just as the man is made to hang up the anns of love in the temple of -VenuS‚
when they had ceased to profit him, in C. iii. 26. 33 or as the slave hung up
his chain to the Lares (see S. i. 5. 65, n), to whom also boys dedicated their
⁴bulla’ when they assumed the ‘to virilis ’ς and, generally, those who
gave up any trade or calling dedicate the instrumente with which they had
followed it to the gods, and to that god, in particular, under whose patrona-ge

they had placed themselves. Hercules would naturally be chosen by a glad· .

iator, or by a soldier. . ,
· 6. Ne populum atr-emal The. gladiatorial shows at this time were exhib-

ited in the CircuS. The arena was separated from the seatS, which went

‘round the building‚ by a wall called the ‘ podium,’ near which a gladiator

woul tation himself to appeal to the compassion of the people, at -whese ·

request usuali ’was that they aot their freedom and the ‘ rudis! We learn
from J nv al, t at the persons of highest condition sat b the ‘ podium,' and
to their in ence the appeal would be more immediate y made. Veianius,
Horace says} retired into the country to escape the temptation to engage
himself again, and to place himself in the position he had so often occupied,

of a suppliant for the people’s favor. When they liked a man, they were not ·

easily persuaded toxask for his discharge.

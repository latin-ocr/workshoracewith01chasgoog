stellation Canis Minor, and called ‘ Ante Canem ’ by a'literal version ofthe
Greek name, rises about the same time, and the sun enters Leo ε, see above,

C. iii. 13. 8, n. ‘ Stella ' is not commonly put for ‘ sidus,' the constellation, “

as it is here.

25. Tu civitatem] See Introduction. As to ‘regnata‚’ see C. ii. 6. 11.
The Seres represent indefinitely the farthest Bastern nations known to the
Romans (see ‚C. i. 12. 56). The Bactrians were formerly part of the Per-
sian empire, andb were at this time artly subject to the Parthians and
partly to a Scythian raee, the Tochari. aetra was their capital. The mean-
mg of Horace is, that Moecenas should not trouble himself about improbable
dan rs.

32⁶ aequore] ‘ Aequore ' is equivalent to ‘ alveo‚’ the·channel of the river.
'Virgil has “ viridesque secant placido aequore silvas ” (Aen. viii. 96). The
next line describes well the quiet flow. of a river.

43. cras vel atra] Compare C. ii. 10. 15. On ⁸ diffinget,' see C. i. 35. 39.
⁶ Vexit' is employed unusually sor ‘ avexit!
⁸ 49: Fortuna suero] The caprice of Fortune, represented as a coqnette
transferring her favors from one favorite to another,.and delighting to trifle
with the happiness of men, is the lowest Epicurean view of life and the
world's government. But Horace writes conventionally. He has just as-
signed to the Father os all the ordering of men’s lives.

51. Transmutat incertos honores,] Compare C. i. 34. 12, sqq.

53. si celer-es quatit] Horace uses ‘ si ' where other writers would nse ‘ sin!

54. resa'yno] This is equivalent to ‘ rescribo ' in a money sense, ‘ to pay
back! ‘ Mea virtute me involvo ' is a picture of aelf-satisfaction. The man
wraps his cloak of virtue complacently around him, and sits down in con-
tented indifference to the proceedings of Fortune, as if she had nothing to do⁸
with him, and n ‘tes himself to verty, as to a bride without a portion.

60. Cypriae yriaeque merces Cyprus abounded in copper and other
metitis, including gold and silver, to ther with precions stones. It exported
wines also and oil. The trade of Pffieoenicia, which at this time formed part
of the Roman province of Syria, was carried on through Sidon more largely
than T which, however, was a port of some consequence under the emper-
ors. orace is speaking generally, and ‘ Tyriae merces ' answered his pur*
pose as well as any other expression.

62. biremis — scaphae] A two-oared boat', ἐλάτης δικὼπου. ‘ Biremis ’ is
not so used elsewhere, but for two banks of oarS.

64. seret] See above, C. iii. 9. 12, n. ‘ Geminasque Pollux ' is an ellip-
tical way of expressingh‘ssl’ollux cum gemino fratre.’ See C. i. 3. 2.

Tms Ode appears to have been written ns an epilogue to the first three

⁶ books, as C. i. 1 was the prolowue. It expresses the conviction, which· time

has justified, that, through his ὃᾶοε, Horace had achievcd an imm'ortal name.
Tho same just pride had been shown by pocts before him ; as by Sappho, in
a poem of which the first li⁶ne only has been preserved, μνάσασθιιί τινά
μι καὶ ὕστερον ἀμμέων (16 Bergk); and by Ennius, in the lines (see -
. ii. 20. 21, n.), —
“ Nemo me lacrimis decoret nec funera fletu

Faxit. Cur? volito vivu' per ora virum,'’
which words virgil has made his own (Georg. iii. 9). Propertius (iii. 1), '
Ovid (Met. xv. 871, sqq.)‚ and Martia! (x. 2. 7, sqq.) have all imitated„

Horace very closely. ·

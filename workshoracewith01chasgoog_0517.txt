‘shelI-fish‚ thrown in without being wished, for the benefit of its saline quali,
ties; for which addition to the sauee he gives credit· to one Curtillus, whoever
he may have been. The superiority os the ‘echinus ' to ‘ muria' (see S. ii.
4. 65, n.) is here said-to consist in the fact of the former coming fresh from
the sea, and furnishing a more perfect brine. ·

54. aulaea] See C. iii. 29. 15, n. The host’s dissertation was brought to
a sudden close by the falling of the tapestry from the ceiling, bringing down
among the dishes an immense cloud of dust. The guests fancy the house is
coming down, but when they find the extent of the damage, they recover them-
selves (‘erigimur’). Rufus §Nasidienum was so disturbed by this untoward
accident, that he put down iis head and began to shed tears. Nomentanus
comforts him with an apostrophe to Fortuna, complaiuing of her caprices, the
solentn'hypocrisy of which makes Varius laugh so immoderately, that he is
obliged to stuff his napkin into his mouth to cheek h'imself. Balatro, who

has a sneer always ready (μυκτηρίζων, see S. i. 6. 5), begins a long sympa-
thetie and flattering speech, with which Nasidienus is highly pleased and com·-
forted under his missortune. A brilliant thought suddenly strikes him, and
he calls for his shoes and goes out, on which the guests begin totitter and to
whisper to one another, not wishing to give offence, or to speak out before the
parasites and the slaves (54 - 78).

72. dyas-a] This was a groom or mule-driver, or otherwise connected with
the stableS. Balatro intends a sneer at the establishment‚ the out-door slaves
being had in to wait at table and swell the'numbcr of attendants. v '

77. Et soleas pescia] See S. i. 3. 127. The sandal's were taken off before
they sat down to diuner‚ for which therefore ‘ soleas demere, deponeress were

when Nasidienus comes in. As to ‘fictis rerum‚' see C. iv. 12. 19, n. ‘Ba-

latrone secundo ' means that Balatro played δευτεραγωνιστής, who support-
ed the principal actor,- but was not. so prominent. (See Eppp. i. 18. 14.) Ba·-
latro was a wit and sarcastic. He supplied jokcs and the others laughed.

86. Mazonomo] This was a large round dish, properly one from which
grain ( Ἔα) was distributed. ”

87. ¹&embra yruis] Cranes became a fashionable dish with the Romane, ⁸
but not till after this'time, when storks were preferred (see S. 2. 50, n.).

88. jecur anseris albae] The liver of a white goose fattened on flgs, tho
legs of a hare served up separately, as being (according to the host) better
,flavored when dressed without the loin8‚ blackbirds burnt in roasting‚ and
wood-pigeons with the hinder parte, which were most so'ught after, removed
(perhaps from the ignorance of the host, who thought novelty was the best
recommendation of his dishes), — these composed the last ‘ ferculum,' brought

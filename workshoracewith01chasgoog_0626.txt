Extractsrom the Preface.

“ 'l‘he Panegyricus has been selected for publication, partly because it is an ex·
callent specimen ot the best manner of Isocrates, and partly because, by its plan, it
presente a review ot the history or Athens from the mythical ages down to the
period following the treaty of Antalcidas. It is a convenient work to make the
text-book for‘lessons in Greek history, affording a central point around which to
“semble the lecding eventsst’

“ 'l‘he Panegyricus or Isocrates, edited by the late Preaident Felton‚ or [larvard
Universum, has just appeared ln a new edition revised by Professor Goodwin‚ the
successor of Mr. Felton in the Greek chair at that University. The oration itseu· is
as familiar to all scholare as the best of the twenty-one extant speeches of Milton’s
⁴ old man eloquent! lt is an encomium on Athens, her material, intellectum, and
moral greatness, and her claime to the chief place among the Grecian stades. De-
livered or published at a time when the Spartan supremacy was almost unques·
tioned, —before the brilliant campaigns oi' Epaminondas had broken the charm of
the Lacedemonian name, —it is a fine compend of the mythical and the authentic

history of the Attic Commonwealth and far superior in truth 'or matter and-greces
or style to the Funeral oration or Lysias, on a hindred theme. In Isocrates, in-

'deed, Grecian rhetoric, as distinguished from oratory, reached its perfectiori, end
few writers in any tongue have excelled him in clear and splendid diction. The

· nei-vous and manly style of Demosthenes may be contr-ested with it3 the one had
the elegance of a writer, the other the trenchant force of a popular orator.

⁸‘ The Panegyricus was the Fourth of J nly.0ration of the Athenians. But this
of Isocrates is, by way of eminence. the Paneoeyricus. It is here printed by Sever.
runcis, ἃ Oo. in the Greek text. with copIous English notes by Mr. Feltom who
delighted to pour out on his readers the wealth of historic and illustrative learning
which he possessed. 'rhe critical skili, which he was less fond of displaving. is in
this edition supplied by the unigenae of Professor enode-ln, whose work on Greek
syntax has already made him a hlgh authority in matters of construction and dis-
puted texts.

“ 'l'he volume before ns is neatly printed, and does credit to the publishers aa
well as to the editors-’²

‘⁴ Messrs. Sever, Francis, ὼ θα, Cambridoee, have publlnhed a new edition of the
Panegyricus of Isocrates. The present edition is edited by Ptofessor enode-in, of
Harvard niniven-sim, who has added grammatienl and other notes, which rive* io-
creased value to the volume. 'l'he Panegyricus is one of the best specimenn of
Isocrates ς and the apparatus furnished ln this attractive addition will fully meet
the wants of the student.'’

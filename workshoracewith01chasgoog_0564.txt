Errsrnu ix,

Wr'rn this composition addresscd' to his book. (which can hardlybe any
other than this collection of Epistles) Horace sends it forth to take its chance
in the world. He addresses it as a young aud wauton maiden‚ puger to ese
cape from the retirement of her home and to rush into dangers she knows
nothing of. He tells her it will be too late to repair her error when she
discovers it; that she will be caressed for a time and then thrown away, an‘d,
when her youth and the freshness of her beauty are- gone, she will end her
davs in miserablc drudgery and obscuri , He concludes with a. description
of himself, hi} person, his character, ειηᾶιῖἰε age.

1. Vertumnum ιΤανιιιηιᾳηες] The Vicus Thurarius‚ in which the Scholiasta ’
saaey Vertumnus had a temple, was part of the Vicus Tuscus (S. ii. 3. 228),-
and the Argiletum was a street leading out of that street. In thc &miletum
Janus had a temple. Tho Sosii were Horace's bookscllers (sce A. P. 345),
and their shop may have stood near templcs of Verturssnus and Janus, at
which Horace says his book is casting longing glauces. The Scholiasts say
they were brothers. The outside skin of the parchment-rous were polishecl
with pumice-stone, to make them look well.

3, -Odo‘sta' claves] The ‘ capsae ' or ‘ scrinia ' (S. i. 4. 21, n.) were. locked,
or scaled, or hoth ; and women and young persons were lockcd or scaled up
in their chambers, that they might not gc't into mischief, which restraint Hor-
ace. says they likcd, if they were chaste. He professes to reproaeh his book
‚for being tired of staying at home, and being shown only to his friends, and.
wanting to go out to be exposed-for sale, to which purpose he had'not trained
it. There can be no doubt that what is here distinetly said of the Epistles is
true of the other works of Horace, that they were shown to his friends, and
circulated privately before they were collected and published.

8. In breve te cossi] As applied to the book, this means that it will be rolled
up and put into a case, and not taken out again. The metaphorica] languago
is -kept up in the following wordS, in ‘ peccantis,' and in the notion of its
being thrown asido when the freshness of youth shall have left it. .

9'. Quodsi non odio peccantis] ⁶ ‘ But is the prophet is not blindcd by his
avemion to the offendcr‚' that is, if 1 am not led by my aversion to your
wantonness to prophcsy too harshly of your fate, ‘Aetas ’. is used for any
ῒίῐῃοὲἰ life, according ἱο the context ; butmorc frequently for old age than

out . -
y 13. Autfiaqies Istic-am] Yon will· be shippcrl off to Utica (in Libya), or to
Ilerda (Lerida) in Spain, or anywhcre else in the-remote provinceS, tied up
as a. bundle of goods (‘vinctus’)‚ and I shall lauh-3, for what is the use of
trying to save such a wilful thing ’.ἱ as the driver sai , when his ass would go
too near the edge of the precipicc, and he drove him over in a passion. It
is not known where this fnblc comes from. Compare Ᾰι. Ρ. 467.

18. balba senectae] This keeps up the image in v. 10³5* Horace says his·
book will be reduced iu its old ag'to the poor pcople's sch ls iu the back

14. qlomus far-time Pyrrhia lanae,] Pyrrhia is said to be the name of a.
'slave in a play of Titinius, who stole some wool, and can-ied it away so clum-
sily that she was detected. Titinius was a writer of comedies who lived
before Terence. Pyrrhia is formed from Pyrrha, th'e name of a town in
LesboS, like Lesbia, Delia, &c- ‘ Glomus ’ is the singular number and
neuter nder. It means a clew or ball of wool. '
15. t cum pileolo soleas] The notion here is of a person of humble sta-

he comes with his cap and slippers under his arm in an awkward manner,
not being accustomed to the ways of fine houses. ‘ Pileus ’ was a skuli-cap,
made of felt, and worn at night or in' bad westher. The man would bring
,it with him, to wear on his way home from the dinner-party. The ‘ solea'

HonAcn appears to have had a discontented ‘ villicusss or steward of his
property, whom he had promoted to that post from having been originally
one of the lower sort of slaves in the town establishment. While in that
position, he sighed for what he· thou ht must ,be tbe superior freedom of the

cess to the tavern and cook-shop, foi-getting, as is common, the vexat-iotis that
had made him long for deliverance before. This man’s disconvent suggested

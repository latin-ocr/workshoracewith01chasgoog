early reminiscencea Trivicum was probably' on a eress road (Cramer, ii.
259) which lay between the two branches of the Appia Via, one of which
took the most direct course from Beneventum through Venusia to Tarentum
and Brundisium, and the oth'er took a more noi-therly course across the
Apennines, near Equus Tuticus3 and then, striking directly eastward till it
arrived very near the sea-coast, near Cannae, proceeded down the line of coast
tiu-it reached Brundisium. · ’

near the Apulian Asculum (Ascoli), and it is in that neig borhood that the
little town with the· unrhythmical name, at which the party stopped after
sl'rivicum, is supposed to have stood. Of its name we must be content to be

bank of the Aufidus, about twelve miles from its mouth, stood the town of
Canusium (canosa), one of the ancient Greek settlements of Apulia. This
town and hersin Apulia (Venusia and Brundisium among them), and in
other parts Eastem Italy, were represented to have been founded by Dio·
med, when, aiter the TroJan war, he was driven to the coast of Apulia, and
hospitably entertained and presented with land by DaunuS, its king. His
name *was retained by the islands now called Tremiti, but by the ancients
Diomedeae. Man remains found among its 'ruins testify to the former im-

water was brought into this town by Hadrian, the emperor. That
A iia was not well watered, has been obser-ved before (Epod. iii. 16, n).
T mrhid waters of the Aufidus must have been unfit for drinking. The
boead of canosa. is described by modern travellers to be as bad as ever. It is
accounoed for by the softness of the milistones.

91. aquae non ditior urna] The only way of taking this regularly is to
make ‘ditior' agree with ‘loeus,’ ‘ which place, being not richer in water
(than the last) by a single pitcher‚ was built by bravc Diomed.’ So Orelli
takes it. The construction is not very agreeablg ς but to avoid it we must-

Ruvo, and was thirty miles from Canusium. The road from Canusium was.

called Via Egnatia, from the town it led to. .A modern traveller describes
the remains of it for tweive miles from Canosa as pared with common rough
pebbles‚ and passing over a pleasant down.

rocky peninsula of a triangular form, about a mile in circumference. It was
an important town o'n the coast, and a municipium.. Its distance from Rubi
was twenty-two miles, ‘⁴ a most disagreeable stony road through a vine
country,” and half-way there lay the town Butuntum (Bitonto). There was
a. hat-bor here formerly, but there is scarcely any now.

Gnatia] This was perhaps the local· way of pronouncing Egnatia. It was
another- seaport town, and thirty-seven miles from Barium. Between them
lay formerly two small forts called Turris Juliana (Torre Pellosa) and Turris
Aureliana (Ripagnola)‚ the first eleven miles and the second twenty miles
from Barium. Of Egnatia nothing important is recorded. Its ruins are still
in existence near Torre d’ Agnazz0‚ six miles from the town of Monopoli.
Horace says it was built under the displeasure of the N ymphs, because the

fore, there is any‘ distinction between them, etymology does not help us to de-‘

termine it.

5. medicam] ⁴ Inserere ' may be governed by ‘ audiar,’ or ‘ meditanS,' or
,both ‘ Meditari‚’ which is akin to μελετᾶν, signifies ‘ to revolve in the mind‚’ ·
and often expresses the giving utterance to that which the mind has conceived·
Here it has the same meaning as Virgil's “ musam meditaris avena‚'' “ me·

' ditaris arundine musam.'’ <
7. Dicam insiyne] ‘ Aliquid ’ or ‘ carmen ’ must be supplied.

· 9.. Exsomnis stupet Euius] This name for the attendants, on Bacchus, like
EuiuS, his own name (C. i. 18. 9; ii. 11. 17), is derived from εὐοῖ (Euoe, C.
· ii. 19. 7), the bacchanal cry. The Euiad catches inspiration by looking out
from the hill—tops upon the haunts of the god, and so the poet turns aside from
his wonted path to the river-banks and groves where Bacchus is found. The
picture of the Euiad looking out with silent awe, through a moonlight winter’s
night, upon the quiet plains of Thrace, and drawing inspiration from contem· .
plating the scenes that her deity frequents‚ is very beautiful.

· 11.- pede barbaro] This refers to the troops of Maenads (Μαινᾶδες from.

μαίνομαι, as Θυιάδες from θύειν, C. i. 17. 23, n.) celebrating the orgies of

this there seems to be no other instance, but perhaps ‘ut’ is used in prefer- ·

enee to ⁴ ac,' because that word occurs in the line before.
14. Naiadum ens Baccharumque] These are the Nymphs mentioned, C.
ii. 19. 3. The acchae, as distingmshed from the Nalades‚ are the wood· .
nymphs (Dryades).

ODE XXVI.

Tms Ode represents a successful gallant’s first refusal, and his mortifica·
tion and wrath at his defeat. It' is a purely fanciful composition.

1 idoneus] He means ‘till now therwomen liked me, and my conquests ,
were great and glorious! The 'words would be suitable to a youthful lover
under the chagrin of a flrst disa pointment. ovid says love is a warsare‚
“ Militiae species amor est, discedfte segnes '' (A. A. ii. 233) 3 “ Militat omnis ,
amans et habet sua castra Cu ido '' (Am. i. 9. 1). The arms this lover pro-
poses to hang up in the temp e of Venus on the left wall, as being most pro·
pitious (but see next Ode, v. 15, n.), are the torch that lightcd him to his
mistreSS, the crowbar that broke open her door, and the bow and arrows which
he carried as emblems of his passion perhaps. For what other purpose he
could use them it is not easy to see.

of the early down upen‘a bey’s cheek. ' The word is nowhere ’else used in

¹this sense. Ἀπτιλος was a name ‘ven by the Greeks to beardless boys.
Boys’ hair was allowed to grow tilflthcy assumed the ‘ toga virilis,’ when
it was cut off, as observed on C. ii. 5. 24. The feathers of a bird are as
,alikeness to the down on a oung cheek as wool, from which ‘ lanugo,' tli'e
⁴usual word in this'setsse, is erived. ’ - - ⁴
6. te spendo videris] ‘ Speculo ' here, without ‘in,' is the ablative of the

instrument. ‘Alterum ⁹ is nowhere else used exactly in this sense, ‘ muta-f
,κοπιᾷ and, though the· word admits of that use, it is so like the Greek ἕτεροι),
which is frequently so used, that I think it is a translation of that· word.
‘ Heu ’ is an exclamation of the poet, not of Ligurinas. What follows is like
two lines in Teuence (Hec. i. Ι. 17, sq.) ι- ,

· “ Eheu me miseram! cur non aut istaec mihi

Aetas et forma est aut tibi haec sententia ’ἓ ”
The mirrors of· the Romans at this time were only of metal, glass mirrors

having been introduced later, and then of an inferior quality.

 

'ODE XI.

Tque Ode professes to be aninvitation ‘tp Hyllis to come and sup with
Horace on the l5th of April, Maecenas’s birthday. It is possible that the

· ode was sent to Maecenas himself, and was only thmwu into the form of an

nddress to Phyllis for poetioel convenience.

Ausones-r. — 1 have a good old amphora of Alban, with parsley and ivy
‚to ,make thee a crown, Phyllis ; silver on my boatu, and an altar that waits
for the sacrifice; the slaves are busy, the fire is buming3 come and celebrate
the Ides of April, for itis Maecenas s birthday, more. sacred uo me than my
own. Telephus is matched already, and is no match for thee. The fates of
Phaethon and Bellerophon teach, thee to beware of ambition. Come, m
last love, with thy sweet voice sing the song I shall teach thee3 song s

2. Albo-m· ardus 51, The wine of the Alban hills was of the better kindg
and at Nassidienus s sup rit was offered to thc chief guest with Falemian
(Sat. ii. 8. 16). Pliny ( Α . H. xime) places it third among the wines of
Italy. Juvenal (v. 33) speaks of Albanian wine, and classes it with Setian,
bort& of ggegt ἓξ. The rich glutton drank it, he sayS‚ as a corrective of yes-

7. verbenis] See C. i. 19. 14, n. -
, 8. Βρωῃίεν αρηος] It has been questioned whether the Romans shed
blood on birthdays. In the earliest times, perhaps they did not, but the

ractice was different in Horace's time, as this passage shows. See also
ην.. xi. 84. ·

10. amitant mixtae pueris puellae 5] ‘ Puellae ' is most rarely used for
female slaves. The word in use was ‘ ancillae?

12. Vertice fimum] ‘ Vei-tice ’ is the top of the flame, which ‘flickers
as it whirls the dark smoke on its creet '3 a spiral fleme, terminating in a
column of smoke. .It seems as if Horace were writing with a. fire buming
before him, and caught the idea as he wrote.

15. marinae] C. i. 3. 1. Venus (Ἀφροδίτη) was said to have risen from
the sea in the mouth of April, which was therefore her mouth, the name of

which Macrobius derives fmm ‹idquit-z Varro, more probably, fmm ‘ epcrioss²

a. superstitious dread of the influenees os the heavenly bodies, which acts-upon
¹vulgar minds. As to ‘ sunt qui s etent,' see C. i. 1. 3, n.

6. Arabus ditantis et Indos,1 omp. C. iii. 24. l. The treasures of the
sea, brought from the East, were chiefly pearls and coral.

7. Lude’crd quid, plausus} This refers to the exhibition of gladiatorial and
, other show8, by which the avor of the people‚ and such rewards· as they could
bestow‚ were sought. As to the singular ‘ QuiritiS,' see C. ii. 7. 3. ·
” 9. sere] This is used much as ‘ prope ' is above. Horace says that sear
and desire are much on a par, both indicating the want of that equanimity
:which he commends at starting. ‘ Miratur ' expresses the astonishment of
sear, as well as of admiration, and so does ‘ stupet ' frequently, and ‘ exterret’
ῗὲρὶἰεξ, like ἐκπλήσσειν, to either state of mind. ‘ Torpet ’ does the same.

'ee . ii. 7. 95, .

15. Insani εαριὶιηιε] Whether ironicaIly‚ or carried away by an unusual fit
of enthusiasm, Horace maintains that a man may seek virtue itself “ultra

quam satis est.” What he meanS, or should mean, is, that excitemeut is to
be avoided in the- pursuit of the chief good as well nis-of subordinate goods.

 

But, by saying that virtue itself may be admired inordinately, he is able to -

introduce with more contemptuous force the vulgar objects of admiration that
follow, respecting which see C. iv. 8. 23 S. i. 4. 283 ii. 3. 118; and other
places in the Satires. .

17. I nunc] The general meaning is, ‘Now then, if you choose, go and
run after fine things and wealth, after.what I have said about excitement and
excess. -

21. dotalibus metat αφἰἱς] This is equivalent to ‘ metat ex agris dotalibus?
as in S. ii. 2. 105 he says ‘emetiris acervo) ‘Emeto’ is not used elsewhere-
Who is meant b MutuS, if anybody‚ is not known ; probably no one iu par-
ticular is allude to. The name, though it occurs in inscriptions, and there-⁴
fore is a Roman name, is perhaps adopted here by way of opposition to the

eloquent man, who by his own exertions was running an unequal raee with
the other man's luck. ,

, 24. Quidquid subterra est] This is like Sophocles (Αἱ. 646) ι

“· ἅπανθ’ ὁ μακρὸς κᾶναρὶθμητος χρόνος

φύει τ’ ἄδηλα καὶ φανέντα κρύπτεται.

f ‘ In apricum ³ means ‘to the rays of the sun,’ ‘to the light of day! “ Horace
means by this reflection‚ that the man need not be in such a hurry to make
hhmself a name, since time would swallow it up, while it brought forward the-
o scure. ,

2 26. Porticus Afflppae] In B. c. 25, Agrippa built the Pantheon near the
Campus MartiuS, to which a ‘ porticus ' was attached. He also built in the
same year, in commemoration of the naval victories of AugustuS, a po‘rtieus,
to which he gave the name Porticus Argonautarum. Which of the two is
referred to, it is impossible to say ; perhaps the second is more likely to have
been called ‘ Porticus Agrippae? '

As to the Via Appia, see Epod. iv. 14 3 S. i. 5. Most of the towns on this
road as far as Capua had country-houscs belonging to wealthy Romans.
Their equipageS, therefore, would frequently be seen on the Via Appia. ,

, 27. Numa quo devenit et Ancus] This is a proverbial way of speaking,
differing little from C. iv. 7. 15, where see note. ’ .

28. Si latus aut renes] ‘ If you are sick, take medicine ; if you want to live
properly, seek the proper meanS, virtue if you think virtue is the way, or
rieheS, or honors‚ or good eating.’ This is the connection of the parts that
follow, this advice being given ironically‚ as observed in the Introduction. ι

30. sonis omissis] ‘ Be resolute, abandon all sels-indulgences, and set about
this work,' that is, the pul-suit of virtue. On ‘fortiS,’ see C. S. 58, n. ‘Hoc
ager’ means ‘ set about this ’3 that iS, the pursuit of virtue. ¹ ·

Sabine stock, of whom the Samnites were one ) Apulia and Lucania were,
at the beginning of this war, independent. states m close allisnce with tho
Samnites, but after the first year they found it stu* their interm to desert
those allies, and joined the Romans} witlt whom they continued to unite their
forces till the end of the war. Horace's supposition that ‚one οι· other of
those states was meditating or carrying on war with Rome, is not, therebre,
strictly accuratu but they were always very doubtful allies, and wem· glad to
assist the-ir old ‚enemim the Gneek ⁴citios in their resistente to Rome, when
they called in the help of Pyrrhns; and it was not till the fan of Tarentum,-

of their army reti-eamd to Venusia, and here many found oefuge after the

wish. He hopes that his adversaries will let him alone, and leave lus ενοι-ά.
(that is, his pen) to rust. From ‘ at ille’ the construction is a. little irregular,
but tho abmptness of the several clauses is well suited to the occasion τ ‘ but

put for drawing the jury. Either way it is equivalent to ‘judiciium'

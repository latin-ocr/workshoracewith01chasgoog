ἐξ Albuti senis] See S. ii. 1. 48, n. The Scholiasts say the savage old
man used to flog bis slaves before they did wrong, “ because,'’ said he,
“ when you do wrong Ι may not be at leisure to flog you.’' ‘ Dido,' ‘to dis-
tribute,' is different in sense and etymology from ‘divido' Thelaner, is
connected with ‘iduo,' ‘idus ' (C. iv.- ll. 16,'n.)‚ the somer with ‘do.’ ‘Di-
do ' is conmonly used b Lueretius. - · ·

68. ω simplet Musas Of Naevius nothing is known. ‘ Simplex ' is iron-
imi. A story is told by Plutarch, in his Life of Julius Caesar (c. 17), of Vale-
rius Leo, who put before the dictator some asparagus covered with ointment
instead offuit Such ‘nimpham’ amounn'ng to an indifference to the decen-
cies of life, and a want of consideration for others, which some people almost
look upon as a virtue, Horace very properly describes as a great vice.

70. Aoeae‘pe nunc] Horace now goes on to show the advantage of moderate
living, especially as connected with health. ' -

77.· (berta -dulniz 5³] This expression is copied from Terence, and means
such a good dinner that you cannot tell what to eat first. Phorm. ii. 2. 28.

7⁴9. Aeque affiyit humo Debauchery not only affecte the body, but de-

resses the spirit, and u ts it for the duties of life. The expression ‘ affigit
gamo ' reminds us of the words of David, ‘f My soul cleaveth to the ground.”
-The same sense, though in a different connection, is conveyed by Cicero’s
words (De Sonent. c. xxi.) ε “ Est enim animus caelestis ex altissimo domi-
cilio depressus et quasi demersus in terram, locum divinae naturae aeternita-
'tique-contrarim’ which serves ‚also to illustrat-e ‘ divinae particulam aurae!

' 93. edlu meprimal See S. i. 3. 99.

94, Das aliquid famae] ‘ I suppose you allow something to good report,
occing that more weleome than music it comes to the ear of man. If so (he
goes on), consider that ‚these luxuries are as discreditable as they arenoxious.
Ano, they leave ou without friendS, and will bring ou to penury.'

95. patinaeque¹ The ‘patine' was a covered dish in which meats were
hrought in hot from the kitchen. ‘ Patruus ' was as proverbial a name for
eguilxgngonsthe ῐὲιαΙὲῚείᾶθ of the family, as ‘noverca ⁹ on the female. See C.

another person or pensons named by him should get the ‘ hereditas! This
was called ‘pupillaris substitutio,' and ma be referred to by Horace in this
place. ‘ Vacua hereditas ' was a common egal term for an ‘ hereditas ’ made?
void by any of the above mamm, or any other. '
49. puer-um eqo-it Oroe,] There is a little moek pathos in this. ‘Ago,'
wizziss the dative, is not a prose construction. See Q. i. 24. 18: “ Nigro eom-
u ‘t i.' · ·
p 53. unffi& rapias] ‘Oculis' is understood after ‘limis‚’ ‘with eye as-

kanee.' The advice given is, that, if the testator should give the man his will ⁸

to read, he should affect indiffercnce and put it from him, taking.care first to
get a side-glauce at its comeum, and see if his name appears in the next line
after the testator'S. A will was commonly written on three pages, which
were called several} ‘prima‚’ ‘ secunda,’ and ‘ima cera,' ‘cera' being equiv-
alent to ⁴ tabula,’ t e will being usually written on wax tabletS. The testa·
tor's name appeared in the first line of the first page, and after his came those
'of the ‘heredes.' In the last page appeared the names of all but the ‘primi
heredes,’ (that is, the ‘ legatarii ’ and ‘ substituti,' see note on v. 48‚) together
with the general provisions of the will. ‘ Solus heres ' would be called ‘ heres
‚ex asse ’ς’ it, there were several ‘heredeS,' they would be ‘ heres ex dodiante,’ »

55. Plerumque recoctus Scriba er quinqueviro] ‘Plerumque ' is used by Hor·
ace in the sense of ‘ interdum' here and elsewhere.. (See A. P. v. 14 and 95.)
The ‘ scribac,' of whom an example occurs above (S. i. 5. 35), were clerks in
public offieeS. These places were often gottby purchase, and the ‘scriba'
received public pay. -Nevertheless the ‘quinqueviri’ appear from this pas·
sage to have ranked lower than· the ‘ scribae) -They were officers appointed
to relieve the other magistrates at night of the charge of the city. These
were the permanent ‘ quinqueviri’3 but extraordinary commissions of five ⁴
were often appointed for various purposes, (See Dict. Antt.) · ‘Reeoctus’
seems to mean that he had been a ‘ quinquevir' and was now a ‘ scriba,’ the
⁸ re' in ‘recoctusf having no particular force. Teiresias mea-ns to say that
Coranus, who had got into a situation in which he had acquired a good deal
of money and some knowledge of business, <vas too wide awake to be caught
in the snare, saw through the attentions of the fortune-humer, and laughed at
him. The ‘ corvus hians ' is perhaps taken from AEsop's fable of the fox and
crow, copied b Phaedrus (i. 13). ' i
57. Captator This word, and ‘ captare ⁹ above (v. 23), are commonly
used for legacy-hunterS. We know nothing more of the actors in this story,
Nasica {ald Coranus* but it. appears likely they were living persone, and the
case we . mown. ·
58. Num furis ἵ] Ulysses does not understand him, and asks if he is fren-
zied‚ as prophets were when inspired.
59. aut erit aut non .·] This is a pompous way of stating a truism, put, by
way of keeping up the humor of the scene, into the prophet’s mouth.

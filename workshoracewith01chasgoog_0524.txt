EPISTLE 11.

Tm} person to whom this Epistle and the eighteenth are written, was prob-
ably the son of M. Lollius, the consul, addmssed in the ninth Ode of the fourth
Book. He was young, but had been with Augustus to the wars, as we leam
from the other Epistle (v. 55). When this Epistle was written, he was at
Rome, eontinuing his education, and Horace was at Praeneste. He had
lately been reading Homer, and from the examples of the Iliad and‘Odyssey
he takes occasion to derivo some advice for Lollius, whom he urges to the
study of philosophy.

1. maxims zoua] - This is probably no more than a familiar and good-
humoredway of addressing the voung inan, ‘ most noble Lollius.’ -
2. Dum ta declamas Romae] Horace writes to Lollius as to one familiar
{gh lerzner’s poenis.) He says of himself, referring to his early education at
me pp. ii. 2. 41 ε ’
“ Romae nutriri mihi contigit atque doceri
Iratus Graiis quantum nocuisset Achilles.’'
After the Romans had begun to ex pand the course of their sons' educafion,
(as mentioned in the note on S. i. 6. 77,) Homer was one of the first authors
a boy studied. Boys attended the schools of the rhetorical masters before
they put on the ‘ toga virilis‚' and there they learnt to declaim upon subjecte
given them from histor . This practice was not introduced till the later

. years of ‘the republic. oung men continued studying declamation long

after they left school. They had teachers at home, who taught them the
higher principles of oratory. Δ “

Praeneste relaeyi 3] Praeneste (Palestrina) was in Latium, about twenty-
three miles due east of Rome. on the edge of the Apennines. It was a cool
retreat, to which Horace appears sometimes to have gone iti-summer, even
when he had a place of his own elsewhere. See·C. iii. 4. 21, sqq.

4. Chrysi ρο et &mator-e] As to Chr sippus the Stoic, see S. i. 3. 126, n‘.
Both he an Crantor were born at the &ilic-ian town Soli. Crantor studied
philosoph in the Academia, under Xenocrates and with Polemo. (See S. ii.
3. 254, ιιῖ They were both voluminous writers But Horace says there is
more instruction in the poems of Homer than in all they ever wrote, and that
it is more clearl eonveyed. Horace takes a wrong view of Homer's poemS‚
-which are not philosophica, nor meant to be so, but noble specimens of art
and poetical conce tion. , ’

7. Bet-bariae] hat is, Phrygia. (See Epod. ix. 6.) · ‘Aestus ¹ is a met·
apher from the ebbing and flowing of the tide, and represents the passione
and variablcness of the princes and people. ·

9. Antenor censet] At a meeting of the Trojan chiefs after the combat of
Hector and Ajax, Antenor proposes to restore Helen to the Greeks, which
Paris flatly refuses, ἀντικρὺ δ’ ἀπόφημι ’γυναῖκα μὲν οὐκ ἀποδώσω (11. vii.

13. Hunc amor,] From its position this seems to belong to ‘Ati-iden)
The allusion is to Nestor's attempt to mediate between Agamemnon and
Achilles, when the former angrily consents‘ to restore Chryseis, whom he
loved above clytemnestra his wife (Il. i. 113, sqq.). , .

19. domitor ijoe] The epithet πτολίπορθος is frequently applied to

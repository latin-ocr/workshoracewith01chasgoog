speaking. Horace says, &Vbnt ἔσκον who goes about the country towns ex-
hibiting, would despise the Olympio prims, it· he had a hope, still· more a
promise, that he should be crowned without a struggle? B this he means,
men strive after happiness in the shape of riches, Suc-3 but i they will leam
wisdom‚ that shall give them all they can desire, without trouble or pain.
The world may judge otherwise, he proceeds to say, and make wealth the
standard of worth; but the world is not to be listened to,—it is foolish

and inconsistent. ‘ Sine pulvere ’ seems to be taken from the Greek ἀκονιτί,
and means without a strug le. . · ·

the front tows! (See 133p0d. iv. 15, n.) ‘Plebs‘ is not used in its regular
sense, but contemptuously. ‘a common fellow.' , The equestrian order con-
sisted of all citizens who had the above income and were not senators; for
when a man became a senator. he ceased to be an ‘e ues.'

59. At pueri ludentes, Rex eris, aiunt,] See note on . i. 36. 8. At Athens,
it appears, the boys had a geme, at which they who threw or caught the buil
best were called king-S, while they who were beaten were called asses, Some
such game must have been in use among the Roman boys, and their king-
making had become a proverb. The world may despise you, he Saye, be-
cause you are poor, but, according to the boys' rule, which makes the best
man king, you shall be a king if yon do well. As to ‘murus aeneuS‚’ see
C. iii. 3. 65, n. For the different senses in which Horace uses ‘nenia‚' see
Epod. xvii. 29, n. Here it signifies a sort pf song of triumph.

64. Et maribus Curiis et decantata Camillis 9] On this plural, see S. i. 7. 8.
The persons referred to are M. Curius Dentatus, the conqueror of Pyrrhae,
and Μ. Furius Camillus, the man who saved Rome from the GauIS. The
contempt of money displayed by Curius is especially related by Cicero (De
Senect. c. 16), in terms which account for Horace’s selecting him for an illus-
tration here. The boys’ strain was ever in the mouths of these noble sol-
diors, giving honor to none but the worthy. ‘ Mares’ is used in this sense
in Α. Ρ. 402. We use ⁴ masculine ⁹ in the same way. ,

67. Ῑαενίηιοεα poemata Pup2‘‚] Pupius appears to have been a writer of
tragedieS, which Horace says were pathetic, but he says it with some con-
tempt. We know nothing more of him ·than this. ‘Lacrimosa' is used
ironIcally. As to ‘responsare‚' see S. ii. 7. 85. ‘Praesens’ means stands
by ou and urges you on, and teaches you to meet the insults of fortune
witz an independent heart and creet bearing. ‘Aptat' is -explained by
“ pectus praeceptis format amicis ’' (Epp. ii. 1. 128), which province be-
longS, Horace says, to the poet. .

71. Νοη ut porticibus sic judiciis] As to ‘ orticuS‚' see S. i. 4. 134. He
has said that the world are not fit guideS, an he goes on to prove this by the
inconsistencies of men, both rich and poor (71 --93). He sisyn, if people ask

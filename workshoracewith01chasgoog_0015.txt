LIFE or 'Holmon

Tm: materials for Horaee’s life are derived almost entirely
from his own works. A few additional facts are obtained from
a short memoir, attributed to Suetonius.

He was born on the 8th of December, A. U. c. 689 (B. c. 65), at
or near Venusia ³¹* (Venosa), in the ApennineS, on the borders of
Lucania and Apulia. ‚His father was a freedman‚† having, as
his name proveS, been the slave of some person of the Horatia
gena„ As Horace implies that he himself was ingenuus,‡ his
father must have obtained his freedom before his birth. He
afterwards followed the calling of a coactor,§ a collector of money
in some way or other, it is not known in what. He made, in
this capacity, enough to purchase an estate, probably a smau one,
near the above town, where the poet was born. We hear noth-
ing of his mother, except that Horace speaks of both his parents
with affectioni} His father, probably seeing signs of talent in
him as a child, was not content to have him' educated at a pro-
vincial school, but took him (at what age he does not say, but
probably about twelve) to Rome, where he became a pupil of
Orbilius Pupillus, ffs who had a school of much note, attended by
boys of good family, and whom Horace remembered all his life
as an irritable teacher, given unnecaesarily to the use of the rod.

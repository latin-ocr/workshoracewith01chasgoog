was then in Syria, after the death of M. Antonius. Shortly afterwards,
however, the Parthians suceeeded in getting rid of their king, and Tiridates
was called to the throne. In B. c. 25, Phraates, having obtained assistance
from the Scythiam, returned and recovered his kingdom3 and Tiridates flcd
to Augustus once more for protection. He was then in Spain. The assem-
bling of the Scythian force, and the alarm of Tiridates, are evidently referred
to herc, and the two seem to be associated. It js natural to infer, therefore,
that it was just before Tiridates ssed from his kingdom, in Β. c. 25, that the
Ode was composed. Δ

ODE, XXVII.

Tms is a convivial Ode, in which the poet sup ses himself at table with
a nois drinking-party. He bids them put away rawls‚ and when they call
upon im to join them, he makes it a condition that a young man of the
party, whose looks betray that heis in love, shall tell him the name of his
mistress. The outh whispers it in his ear, and the poet breaks out into

compassion for is hopeless situation. The Ode is said to be imitated from ⁴

Anacreon.

ODE XXIV.

'l'ms Ode is of the same elam, and was probably written about the same
time as the eudy ones of the third book, i. e. about A. υ. c. 728 It deals with
the licentioris ahusen of the times, and points indirectly to Augustus as‘the
real reformet of them, as in the second Qde of the first book. The variety of
images and {humatione in this Ode is very remarkable, and they are partica,
larly well chonen and original. There is none that exhibite Horace’s peculim·

· . style more completely than this does.

Amanum· — Let a man be as rich and extravagant as he may, yet, when
Face overtakes him, fear and death will seiae him. The wanden-ing tribes of
the North—with their free plains and toils equali shared, where step-mothers
are 'kind and wives are obedient and elmete, an where crime meets with its
reward -— are happier thim¹ we are He who would gain a name for future
times (for merit. is only recognized after death), let him ‚put a check upon the
licentiousness ρξ’ the age, Os what use is it to compium, if crime goes un-

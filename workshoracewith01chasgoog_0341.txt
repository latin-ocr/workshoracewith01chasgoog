In the year B. o. 53, M. Licinius (li-assuti, as consul, with the province of
Syria, marched an army into Mesopotamia against the Parthians. He sus-
tained a disastrous defeat at the hands of Surenas, the Parthian general, and
lost his own life, with 20,000 men killed and lo,000 prisonem, besides several
eagles. Again‚ in the year Β. o. 36, Μ. Antonius attaeked the Parthians, and

· was obliged to retreat with great loss.

There would seem to have been generally prevalent at Rome a feeling of
soreness and iun-patience under the disgrace‚s0· long· unredeemed, of these

. reverses3 and this feeling it appears to· be Horace's purpose in this Ode to

allay, and to discourage any hope or desire for the return of the Parthian
prisonem. Tliisdesire Horace seems to impunc to a degenerata spirit, and
the story of Regulus is introduced apparently to eall back‘men's minds to the
feeling of a former generation. ·
The standards and many of the prisonem were restored by Phraates, Β. c.
20, as an act of conciliation towards Augustu8‚ a'nd their recovery was pro-
claimcd as a triumph, and recorded upon coins with the inscription “ Signis

. oeeepfis.” This fiction is repeated in C. iv. 15. 6. Epp. i. 12. 27 ; 18. 56.

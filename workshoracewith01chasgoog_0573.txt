174. percurrat pulpita socco ,·] The frent part of the stage where the actors
spoke was called ‘ pulpitum‚' by the Greeks λογεῖον. As to ‘ soccus,-’ see S.
i. 3. 127, n. It was worn by eomic actorS, as being a less dignified order of
{2222135ffffissitssfflffi‘tffnfflss·22 othffg’uffifsffi‘fflisstgg‘sszffl
‘baxeae’ and ‘crepidaef for the same reason, each being a loose sort of
slipper, and the latter not materially different from the ‘soccus’ Horace
means that Dossennus is careless in the‘eomposition of his playS, which ho
expoesses by his running about the stage with loose slippers. His only care,
he says, is to make money.

177. ventoso Glon'oecurw} See S. i. 6. 23, n.

185. St discordet eques] See S. i. 10. 76, n.

186. Aut ursum aut puyiles ,·] Augustus himself had a liking for boxerS, as

mentioned on Epp. i. 1. 49. The interruptions to the regular drama. which ,

Horace here mentions appear to have been of common occurrence. Though
the acting of plays was in Horace’s time carried on in a theatre (v. 60, n.)
ereeted for this special purpose, it appears the people insisted sometimes on
having a bear-batt or a boxing-match there to amuse them, in spite of the
remonstranees of the equites in the front rows‚ who, however, Horace says,
were themselves taken too much with processions and shows that appealed

more to the eye than to the ear.
187. Veram equitis] ‘But with the eques, too, all his pleasure was shifted

from the ear to the eri-ing eye and vain delights.’ He means that the eye is
easily dazzled and deluded. , The ear takes in what it receives, and eonveys
it to the mind without error. .

189. aulaea premuntur] At the back of the stage was the ‘ scena,’ or wall
on which was painted some scene suitable to the performanee. Before this
” ‘ seena' was a curtain, which was let down below the stage when the acting

began, and raised when it was over. This eurtain was called ‘aulaeum.’

'‘The mising of the curtain at the end of the play is referred to in A. P.
154 s . .

“ 1ἷ11ἶ1 reyumfinuna] This is equivalent to ‘ fortunati reges! The expression

is like those noticed at S. i. 2. 32; ἱὶ. 1. 72.

192. Essetlafestinant‚] The ‘essedum ' was originally ‚the name of a Brit-
ish or Gaulish war—chamot, derived from a Celtic root. The name came to
be applied to ,a travelling carriage on two wheels and drawn by two horses,
The ‘ pilentum ’ was a carriage used in processionS, and appears to have been
usually of a luxurious kind, with well-stuffed cushions, and used by women.
It was also a travelling carriage. As to ‘petorritum,' see S. i. 6. 104pn„

and E .i.11. 28 n.

193.p{aptiva Corinthus] The taking of Corinth may have been represented
by spoils of Corinthian bronze. .

194. Democritus‚] See Epp. i. 12. 12, n. Democritus had the character of
a laughing philosopher, one who turned things habitually into ridicule. ε·

196. Sive elephas albus] The king of Ava has for one of his man titles
the Lord of the White Elephant; and it has been usual :for the Britis gov-
ernment, when an elephant of this color was caught in their territoricS, to
send it with due ceremony as a. present to his Majesty¹ White elephants are
, merely lusus naturae.- they are not a distinct speeies, 'as some have supposed. ·

They have ‘'pink eyeS, like other albinOS, but do not differ from the brown
animal in other respects. They are not common.

198. mimo] See S. i. 10, 6, n.
- 202. Garyanum muyire putes] See C. ii. 9. 7. ·

207 . Lana Tarentino] The different shades of the purple dye were obtainefl
by different mixtures of the juice of the ‘ murex ¹ with that of the ‘ pumura‚’
-both of which were eheu-fieb, found in great abundance on both coasts of Italy.

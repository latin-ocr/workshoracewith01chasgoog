, 15. pins Aeneas] Horace's purpose is to show that no means are sufficient
to bring back the dead, not piety,'nor wealth, nor power. There is a similar
velsg. 12341293214‘12· {galeris anima] ‘ Whate'er thou givest thine own dear

seul! This seems to be a litei-al version of φίλῃ ψυχῇ χαρίζεσθαι.

sqq.). See also Vi . Aen. vii. 765, sqq. ·

27. Nec Lethaea met] The common story of Theseus and his friend is,
that, both having been consigned to their punishment together, Hercules
went down and delivered Theseus, leaving Peirithous to his fate. This may
be the legend Horace follows: for it may be understood that Theseus pleaded
for Peirithous when he was himself retaining, but failed to obtain his release.

much beloved‚ according to VelleiuS‚ who says 'of his death (in Α. D. 2 ,

he would esteem an Ode of his more highly than any costly gifts he could
offer, in accordance with the common practice among friends of making each

the J rthine, rather than any of the other African wars, is referred to, be-
cause allust's history had lately come out, and was attracting much attention.

29. Quis non Latino] In this and the following stanza Horace am lifies a
little. But during the civil wars of Julius Coesar, S in, Greece, an Africa
were soenes of much bloodshed‚ and Romans song t against each other at
Mutina, at Philip i, and at Actium. That the Parthian had heard the crash
of Italy in its fal , is a poetical exaggeration, meaning, in plain prose, that
the bitterest enemy of Rome had watched her dissension8, and rejmced in the
prospect of her downfall. ·

ODE II.

nomon, meaning to write an Ode on the moderate desire and use of·
wealth, dedicated it to C. Sallustius CrispuS, grand-nephew of the historin,
and inheritor of his property. He had previously alluded to him in no
terms of praise in Sat. i. 2. 48; but that Satire was written many years
‘before this Ode, and at this time Sallustius was in high favor with Augustae,
anddpossessed of great riches‚ of which Horace implies that he made a
goo use. ·

Amnum. -— Silver hath no beauty‘while hid in the earth, Sallustius.

2. Abdita terris‚] Sallustius possessed some valuable mines in the Alps,
and to this circumstance Horace seems to refer. The character given of
Sallustius bv Tacitus (Ann. iii..3o) is rather different from Horace's de-
scription. Tacitus says he was inclined to luxurious living and fine clothes,
different from the practice of the old times. , Horace inverts the order of the
cognomen and gentilician name, as Tacitus frequently does ; ηε, ‘ Agrippam
Postumum’ (Ann. i. 3), and elsewhere. The eleventh· Ode of this book is

addressed to Quintius Hippian-‘33 and the names are iuven-ted, as here. ‚

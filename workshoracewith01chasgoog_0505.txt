23. sponsorem me rapis] ‘ Sponsor' was one who became security for

another under the form of contract called ‘ verborum obligatio,' the contract
taking place by question and answer, ‘ ex interrogatione et responsione)
One asked the other, “ Dari spondes ‘3⁴' and he answered, “ Spondeo.'’ The
principals were called ⁴ stipulator-‚³ he who asked the question; and ‘ ro-
missor‚’ he who answcred. The sponsor was said ‘ intercedere,' and to im
the samequestion was put, to which he returned the same answer. This ex-
plains ‘respondeat' in v. 24, and “ quod mi obsit clare certumque loeuto‚” v.
27. He answers “spondeo '' in a clear, distinct voice, and becomes liabie,
possibly to his great detriment. The words, ‘Eja‚ ne prior‚' ete„ Horace

332. atras—Esquilias] See S. i. 8, Introduction. The former character
of the place is expresscd by ‘atraS,’ gloomy. He says, that as soon as he
gets near Maecenas’s house he begins to remember a hundred different com·
missions intrusted to him by his acquaintance. They flit about him like a
swarm of gnate, or anything else that is teasing.

v 35. Roscius orabat] Roscius may be anybody. It appears he had pre-seed
Horace to meet him next day at the Puteal Libonis. This was some sort of
building in the Forum Romanum, erected by one of the Scribonia gens, and
therefore called ‘ Scribonianum! The place or its neighborhood was the
resort of money-leaders, It was probably an enclosed place, open at the
top, and took its name from the stone enclosurcs· built round welle, ‘putei.’

in common, and must have held meetings to diseuss questions that concerned
their body. As Horace had belonged to them, and was now known to have

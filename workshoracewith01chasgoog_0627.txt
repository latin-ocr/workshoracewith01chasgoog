Extr'act from tlte Preface.

‘⁴ The greatness of the genius or Aristophanes is not generally appreciated, and
tho value 01· 1118 comedies as illustratione of the political antiquities, the life,

morals, and manners of Athens, is not fully understood. 'l'he truth is‚' we are
indeboed to him for information upon 1118 working of the Attio institutione, which,
had 811 1118 plays been lost, we should have vainly sought for 111 the works of other ’
authors. No intelligent reader 0811 doubt that Aristophanes was a man of 1118111081
profound acquaintance with the political institutions οἱ 1118 838, no reader of poetic
fancy can fail to see that he possessed an extraordinary creative genius. It is im-
possible 10 study 1118 works attentively , without feeling that his was one of the mas-
ter minds or the Attio drama. The brightest flashes of a poetical spirit are con-
stantly breaking out from the midst of the broadest merriment and the sharpest
satire. An imagination of endless variety informs 111088 lyrical passages which gem
1118 works, and are among the mostxpreeious brilliants of the Greek language. In
the drawing or characters his plays exhibit consummate skill ..... Τ118 00111811]
‘of the Clouds is, fur many reasons, one of the most interesting remains of the
theatrica! literature of Athens. Though, like every other -comedy‚ its wit turris
upon local and temporat-y relations, it has, what is not common to every other
eomedy, a moral import of permanent value. lt was written at a time of great
changes in the national character of the Greeks, and bears marks of its author’s

determined opposition to the new 81111081 and philosophicai views that were eating
into the very 118811 of 1118 national virtues.”

,Preface to tlte Fam-tn Edition.

‘⁴ In this new edition of the clouds the commentary has been revised, corrected,
and in some instances enlarged. An Appendix to the Notes 1188 been added, con·
taining references to Professor Goodwln²s ‘syntax of Moods and Tenses of the

⁴ Greek Verb,’ a work which »has already taken its place among the most valuable

aids to the student in acquir-ing a knowledge oi* the retinements of the Greek lan-
811880·

“The clouds is one of the three or four pisces of Aristophanes which are .
least tainted with indecency and 0081888888. Nothing therefore has been omitted
from the text of this edition, 88 but little danger is apprehended to the morals of
young men from a few ‚freaks of an old Athenian’s gamesome 181831881108, to be
interpreted only by an assiduous use of the grammar and lexicon ..... The text
of this edition oi* the clouds is printed from Dindorf‘s Poetae scenici Graeci. In
some few passages the readings of Hermann have been preferred. In.the prepara-
tion of the Notes, the labors of others have been freely used, particularly the
elegant commentaries of that elegant Hellenist, Mr. Mitchell‚ whose editions of the
separate comedies, notwithstanding 0008810881 811018 in minute points of Grt'ek
grammar, are an honor to English scholarship. The excellent edition of the Clouds·
by Theodor Koek has been 0088811811, and valuable remarks have occasionally been
taken from his Oom mentary ..... Some of the marm-inis of the notes and illus-
11811088 have been drawn from the editor-’s personal observations in Greece3 others
are drawn from the curious analogles of the follies and impostures flourishing in
the present day, with those effectively and wittily handled by the poet.'’ ,

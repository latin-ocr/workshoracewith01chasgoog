'ms Am or Pomm. 573

292. Pompilius unquis-,1 The ‘ Calpurnia gens,’ to which the Pisones ,
belonged, claimed descent from Calpas, son of Numa Pompilius.

294. ad unyuem] See 8. i. 5. 32, n.

295. Inqenium misera] The following verses⁴ to 308 have little connection
with what goes before. Horace says, because genius is above art, and all
poem, according to Democritus, are mad, many neglect their persons and let
their ' nails and their beands grow, affecting insanity. The question'about
education and nature in connection with poetry is taken up again at v. 408.
We are aeeustomed to subscribe to the doctrine “ poeta nascitur, non fit.’'
The ancients were divided on that point, some assigning more to education,
others to natural gifts.. Cicero more than once alludes to the opinion of
DemocrituS, that no man could be a poet without inspiration.

300. Sa· tribus Anticyris] There were three places of this name, each of
which is assumed from this passage to have produced helleboro, a very im-
probable· coincidence. Horace uts ‘ tribus ’ as we might say a. (lezen, or
any other indefinite number. (goe 8. ii. 3. 83.)

301 . Tonsor-i Licino commiserit] This name was probably that of a well-
known barber of the day. See S. ii. 3..16. 35, n.)

302. Qui puryor bilem] he hellebore which the ancients used in cases of
madness is a violent purgative, and they tried to act 'ou the brain by relieving
‘the stomach. Horace says he must be a‘fool‚· since madness is essent-ial to

Horace sa s if he only kept the bile from escapiug, he would beat them all at
poetry. However, it does not matter, he goes ou 3 he will act as the grind-
stone which whets the iron, though its own office is not to cut (exsors ipsa
secandi). This is said to be a proverbial way of speaking.

310. Rem tan· Socraticae —chartae,] The writings of Socrates's disciples,
such as Plato, Xenophon, AEsehineS, Antisthenes, Aristippus, will supply
nxz-affer for lt'hfg true (dramatic) poet, by teaehing him the seleuce and duties

314. Quod sit conset-{pta} After the expulsion of the king-s, the senate hav-
ing lost many of its number un‘der the last of them, tho vaeancies were filled
up from the ‘ equites,' who were called ‘ conscripti senatores? The others
were ‘ patres '3 and the whole body thus constituted was called collectively
‘ patres et conscripti,' or shortly ¹ patres conscripti.' Horace here uses ‘ eon-
scriptus ⁹ as equivalent to ‘senator.' It is nowhere else so used. As to
‘judiciS‚' see S. i. 4. 123, n.

318. vium hinc ducet-e voces] Living words are those that represent nature
to the life, or which eonvey a vivid sense to the understanding.

3119. speciosa locis] Fun of telling commonplacesasentiments, examples,
an so on. . ·

323. Graiis inpertiam] He says the Greeks had a natural taste for poctry,
and cultivated it from an ambition to excel and thirst for praise. But this
comparison of the Greeks and Romans does not appear to be connected with
the subject that goes before, or the rules that follow from v. 333.

325. Romani pueri] See S. i. 6. 72, 77, n. The ‘as’ was divided into
twelve parts, ‘ unciae,’ of which the ‘ quincunx ’ contained five, and the
⁸ triens ' four, being one third of the whole, whence the name. The ‘ semis '
(semi-as) contained sixfibeing half an as. tiAlbinus is said to lave beess thie

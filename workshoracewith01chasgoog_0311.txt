- · 13. sem: Aetas Time is compared to a wild horse, as in Ovid (Fast. v'i.
7Z2J: “fugiunt neno non remorante dies.'' The words that follow mean,
‘³1oe will approach the flower of her age, as you recede from it ' 3 which is ex-

reesed thus: ‘the years which time takes from your life, he will add to
ers! The way of speakin is like that of Deianira, when, comparing her
own age and attmctious witfi those of her rival, she says :—
ὁρῶ ικὰρ ἥβην τὴν μὲν ἕρπουσαν προσω,
τὴν δ αὖ φθίνουσαν. .
ξιὸορίιέὴΤῗξὲιὸ v. 547, sqq.) It is also explained by those verses in the Epis-
e to e ' nes :—
⁴⁴ Multa ferunt anni venientes commoda secum,
Multa recedentes adimunt.” '⁴

(v. 175, sq.)

16. Lalaqe] This name is formed from λαλεῖν, “dulce loquentem” (C.

i. 22. 24 .·

2ο. cin-fidium nyend This name, which is Lydian, Horace employs again

(C. iii. 7. 5). This boy is represented us a slave from Cnidus in Caria, and
he is said to be so beautiful that, if he were introduced at supper among the
girls, the clevet-est of the company could not detect him. ‘ Discrimen obscu-
rum ’ means a differ-enee hard to see.

24. ambiqwqtae vultu] Ovid expresses the same ambiguity in the case of

Atalanta very elegantly (Met. viii. 322) :—

“ Talis erat cultus ; facies quam dicere vere
virgineam in puero puerilem in virgine possis.'’

Boy¹sh let their hair grow till they assumed the ‘toga virilis,' about their fif·
teen year.

ODE VI.

Or Septimiae, to whom this Ode is addressed, we know nothing, except
that he was an intimate friend of Homee’s, as we gether also from the letter of
introduction he gave him to Tiberius (Epp. i. 9). He had a house at Taren-
tum, where Horace probably paid him one or more visits. Beyond this we
know nothing of SeptimiuS.

It was probably on or after a visit to SeptimiuS, that Horace composed the
tfentyt‘tfighge ῗᾶρ 01?th ‘fir-isthlgook ;teantg'' Iggbabl , wigh tht?1 {maetgzns'ff’f

arenm s1n1 m, wro is e. esys a-,ncx01-

buri:3 it is· t13e pl5ace where he would choose to end his dayS. He says the sume
m pp. ι. . .

Anemmm. — Septimiae, 1 would that I might end my days at Tibur, or,
if that be forbidden me, at Tarentum. Above all others I love that spot,
with its honey, its oliveS, its long spring, and mild winter, and grapcs. on
Mount Aulon. On that spot we ought to live together; and there thou
shouldst lay my boneS‚ and weep over them. ·

1. Septimi, Gades aditure mecum] That is, ‘ who art ready to go with me,
if need be, to the ends of the earth? See above C. 2. 10, n. =.
. 2. Cantabrum indoctum] At any time before B. c. 29, when the Cantabri
were first reduced, they could have been called by Horace ⁴ indoctos juga
fen-e nostra‚' even though-no attempt had been made to impose that yoke.
In 29 they were reduced to subjection; in 26 they broke out again, and in the
following year they were finally subdued, though an insurrection had to be
put-down by Agrippa, some years afterwards (see C. iii. 8. 21; iv. 14. 41.

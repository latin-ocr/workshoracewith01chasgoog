ῖ 86. stipantem 9] It is possible this may mean ‘ service,’‘ which is its
military sense3 or it ma be ⁴ penalty,’ but the meaning is doubtful, ‘ Quae
finis ’ means ‘ what dea 3 ' Captives led in triumph were always put to
death. See C. iv. 2. 35, n.

40. sonari .·] ‘ Sono ’ is used as ‘an active verb only by the poets, after
the manner of ἠχεῖν. The satire of what follows is very amusing. In his
plea for forgiveness he repeats his offence, implying that to call her chaste he
must lie, which, however, he is willing to do. ’ The following words‘are the
substance of what he promises to say in her praisc, placing her, like Ariadne
and other virtuous women, among the constellatione.

42. Insamis Helenae] The story is, that ⁴Stesichorus (C. iv. ⁹. 8, n.) was
struck with blindness for writing a libel on Helen, and that on writing a rc-

cantation (παλινωδία) hc was restored to sight by Helen, or, as Horace here:
{tysissgpz‘sisafiffiz aaz&&gasaiwanaseszsffsz
”2252ssss 2232, ωῶῗιῖειξιε ἵξθοῑᾛέἴιαζὸηωιω in entreaties both in Greek
(δύνᾳ γάρ) and Latin. ' ’

46. 0 nec palemis] ‘ Ο thou who art not debased by the sins of thy

parents, who art not an old witch skilled in sprinkling on the ninth day the
ashes on the tombs of the poor! In this way, while he pretends to recent, he
makes his language more libellous than ever. ’
· obsoleta] This is applied in an unusual sense. It usually signifies that
which is gone to dccay (out of use), as clotth, houseS,'faded pletu1e8,·&c.
(see Forcell.), and so it comes to mean generally that which is spoilt and·
worthless, as here. Sec C. ii. 10. 6. ,

48. Novendiales] It appetu-S, if we are to believe the old commentators,
to‘have been the practice to bury the ashes nine days after death. Therefore,
Horace, means to sa that the w1tch dug up the ashes of the dead immediately
after their burial, w ile they were stesh, 'and better suited on that account for
&temtantes‹21132‘1ffi3h051553233533oe‹fisssflezffixsess‘i”Rsssfsseffgssfi
fies ‘ of nine days’ continuance,’ but it cannot have that meaning here.
Hector was buried aflier nine days (114 xxiv. 784).

50. Pau-que venter Pactumeius,] In Epod. v. 5 it is insinuated that Canidia
is childless, that the children she pretends to have are not herS, and her child-
births are a fiction, perhaps to extmct money from her loverS, on whom her
preoended children were affiliated. Here the libel is withdrawn, but in such .
a way as to leave it untouclxcd, for in the last line he insinua-tes that her
travail is at least not very difficult. ‘ Venter’ is used by the law-writers to
&cresus
that would have been intelligible at the time. ἵ

53. Quid obseratis] From this point Canidia is supposed to repl .

56. ut tu riseris] ί Ut ² is an exclamation of scom- “’ To thiu that yon—
should.’ It occurs again (S. ii. 5. 18) : “ Utne te am spureo Damae latus! ''
The festival in honor 'of Cotys or Cotytto was of hrac1an origin, and trans-
ferred to Corinth and other Greek states. It found its way into Sicily, but ⁸
was never introduced into the¹ Italian states, and was unknown-at-Rome ex-.
cept to the learned. The n'tes of this goddess were very impure, and, like
other works of darkness, professed secrecy, as Juvenal says (ii. 91) :—

“ Talia secreta coluerunt orgia taeda
Cecropiam soliti Baptae lassare Cotytto.”
Canidia is made to call her witch’s orgies Cotyttia, by which the libel that

runs through the poem is maintained.
58. Et Esquilini Ροπῑξζῇιυεηεῇεἰ] . She charges him with thrusting himself

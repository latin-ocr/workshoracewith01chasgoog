.‹ l. 0 neta meeum} Horace was born· n. c. 65, when L. Manlius Torquatus
und L. Aurelius Cotta were consuls, iii which year the amphora addressed is
here said to have been filled. (See above, C. iii. 8. 12, n.) ⁴ Testa,' which

felt.than rendered. ‘ Gentle ' is Francis's translation, an I know no better,
for the meaning is to be derived from its connection with ‘ facilem somnum?

, 11. Narratur et prisci Catonis This is the Cato mentioned on C. ii. 15. 11.
His being fond of wine is most ikel an invention of Horace's.

13. Ta lene tormentum inyaenio] ’ζ’
ungenial temper! ‘ Duro ingenio' means the reserved temper Whose sym-
pathioe and purposes are not easily drawn out, as in Terence (Phorm. iii. 2.
12), “ Adeon’ ingenio esse duro te atque inexorabili.”

14. sapientiam] This applies to the philosophical and thoughtful (as ‘ sapi-
entia ’ is put for philosophy, C. i. 34. 2), who have little to do with mirth till
they are -brought out of themselves by cheerful company. · lt is said that· in
his Odes Horace always uses the termination ‘ ium ’ for the genitive plural of
nouus ending iit ‘enS‚’ and sor participles the termiiiation ‘ tum.' But the
instances of either are not numerous enough to determine a mle, and the so·
called nouns are usually participle8‚ as ‘ sapiens ' ie.

18. ωνηηα] That- is, strength and confidence‚ of which horus were the
symbol. See C. ii. 19. 30, n.

19. Post te] “ Quis post vina gravem militiam aut pauperiem crepat? ’⁹

(O. i. 18. 5.) As to ‘apieeS,' see C. i. 34. 14.
· 21. Te Liber] He sayS, ‘ Thee, Liber, and Venus (if she will be cheerful
and come), and the Graces slow to .loose the bond that binds them, and the
burning lampa, shall protract even until Phoebus on his return puts the stara
to night! The meaning is, the wine shall go round and the lamps shall
bur-n, with jollity and love (women commonly were of the company on these
occasions) and good humor sor our companionS, tin suni-ise.

22. Semiesqioe nodum solvere} ‘ unwilling to be separated.’ As Horace rep- -

resents the Graecs naked‚ or with loosc robes (C. i. 30. 5, n.), ‘nodum ’ can-
not siguify the zone, as some commentators say. It seems to mean the bond·
that unites them. They are usually 'groupcd with their arms iniertwined.
Here the represent good humor, as opposed to brawling.

became a source of historical information. There were also consular anneis,
or registcrs of the consuls and other chief magistrates, kept among the records
of'the state, and these were. also called ‘fasti‚' or ‘annaleS‚' eit-her of which
words came, in consequence, to be used generally sor historical registers of
any kind, particularly by the poets. Horace applies it to the family geneal-
ogies of the Lamia family (C. 1ii. 17. 4). See also C. iv. 13. 153 14. 43 and

S. ὶίἒ. 112, where it is applied in the most general way to the history of the

49. Libitina] See S. ii. 6. 19, n.
50. ,Εηηὲιιε et sapiens] Ennius was born at Rudiae, in Calabria, Β. c. 239.
. He followed the opinions of Pythagoras, holding the dd'ctrine of the transmi-

gration of souls; and in the beginning of his epic poem, called ‘ Annales‚’ he =

declared that the spirit of Homer had passed into his body, having mean-
while inhabited‚ among others, that of a peacock. This is what Horace al'-
ludes to in ‘somnia P hagorea.' He says, however, that Ennius need not
mind what was thoug t of his professione and his dreams, since he was cer-
tainly worshipped as if he were a second Homer. As to ‘ critici,’ see Epp. i.
19. 40, n. Ennius is called ‘fortis,' not for his persona-l bravery (though he
saw some service), but for the boldness of his style.

53. Naevius in manibus noa est] Cn. Naevius was born about the middle of

. the third century B. c., and wrote plays and an epic poem on the first Punic

war, in which hc served.. To the latter poem Virgil seems to have owed
some of his ideas. Terence ranks him, with Plautus and' Ennius, as one of

Α his mochS. Naevius 'was perhaps rather the oldest of the three. Cicero often
,has ‘non est ’ in interrogative sentences. ' ·

54. Paene recens 2] ‘ As if he were almost modern?

56. Pacuvius docti famizm sem's,] Pacuvius was nephew to Eumne, and
was born, like his uncle, in Calabria, about B. c. 220. His chief compositions
were tragedies, and they were nearly all translated from the Greek. A scene

from his Orestes is referred to by Cicero (De Amicit. c. 7), and he elsewhere -

places him at the head of the Roman tragedians. . ‚

In respect to Accius, see S. i. 10. 53, n.

As to ‘senis,' see S. ii. 1. 34, n.

57. Dicitur A finni toya] Comcdies written after a Greek model, with
Greek soenes and characterS, were called ‘ palliatae ' ;' those of which the in-
cidents and persons were Roman were called ‘ togatae,' from ..the dress of the
actors, the Greek ‘pallium’ corresponding to the Roman ‘toga' Afranius
wrote principally ‘ togataS,' and Horace says that, according to the judgment
of the critice), his toga would have suited Menander ; that is, Menander need

· not have been ashamed of his plays. Afranius was some years younger than

Caecilius and Terence. -
· Of Menander, who flourished at Athens during the latter part of the fourth
century n. c., mention has been made on S. i. 4. 1. Horace seems to have

studied Menander. (See S. ii. 3. 11, n.) -
58. Plautus ad exemplar Siculi properare ,Epicharmifl As to Horace's
opinion of PlautuS, sce below (170, sqq.).- What ' critics meant, when

they said what Horace here attributes to them, I do no know; and since we
have no means of comparing the writings os Plautus and Epicharmus, I do
not sec how the question can be decided. EpicharmuS, a native of Cos, lived
from B. c. 540 to the age of ninety. The chief part of his literary life was
spent at the court of Gelon and his successor Hiero, at Syracuse, with Pin-
dar, AEschylus, and other poets who were patronized at that court, where he
composed comedies, thirty-five of which are known by their titlcs and some
by fragments. He is commonly called the inventor of comedy, the fact being,
perhaps, that his were the first that were written.

434. alluuie] This the Scholiasta (on C. i„ 31. 11) say was the name of
earthen-ware cups used by the pontifices and ,Vestal VirginS. It was after-
wards used generally for drinking-cupa. With ‘torquere mero ’ compare
Epp. i. 18. 38, “ et vino tortus et ira.’'

437. animi sub vulpe latentes] ‘ If you ever write *poen-y, do not be taken
in by flattererS, who have a bad heart under a cunning face.'

438. Quintilio] See C. i. 24, Introduction.

441. Ec male tornatos incudi reddere] The metaphora of the turning-lathe

the ancients as a critic, was born in Samothracia about n. c. 230. He passed
the greater part of his life at Alexandria, under the pau-onage of Ptolemaeus
Philopator, EpiphaueS, and Philometor, the second of whom he educated.

453. morbus reyius] This, which is otherwise called ‘ arquatus morbus,’
‘ aurngo,’ and by the Greeks ἵκτερος, is the jaundice. Celsus says it is so

96. Te us et Paene] These persons were the subjects os many trage-
dieS. Eae of the three tragedians wrote upon them, and fragments of their
plays are extant. Telephus s abject condition, when he went to seek for one
to cure him of his wound (see Epod. xvii. 8, n.)‚ and Peleus, driven from
AEgina, and wandering in quest of a purifier sor the. murder of his brother
Phocus, appear to have been the points in the history of these persons chiefly

113. equites peditesque] This is a comprehensive way of vex ressing all the
citizens of Rome, with reference to their division by Servius ullius (Livy i.
43). When the census was complcted, the king issucd a proclamation. “ Ut
omnes cives Romani equites peditesque in suis quisque centuriis in Campo
Martio prima luce adessent.'’

114. ᾱίυιιεηε quuatur an heros] The Scholiasts are divided between ‘di-
vus ' and ‘ Davus '; the MSS. are also at variance. ‘ Deus ’ and ‘heros ’ are
brought together below (v. 227) : “ Ne quicunque deus, quicunque adhibebi-
tur ieros.'' ’

116. matrona potens] This epithet seems to have the same meaning as its
kindrcd word πότνια, so common in Homer and the Tragedians. The
officious nurse has always been a favorite character on the stage. We find it
in AEschylus (Choephoroe), in Sophocles (Trachiniae), and Euripides (liip-
polytus). An ἕμπορος (‘mereator') is introduced in the Philoctetes of Soph-

γ 11(8. ΟοΙεΙιωὲἳιη Assyriae] The Colchian may be put perhaps for any of
the barban-ons tribes on the shores of the Euxine, and the Assyrian for any of
the Eastern nations. (See C. i. 2. 21, n.‚ and C. ii. 11. 16, n.) The oppo-
sition between Thebes and Argos has reference partly perhaps to the play of
AEschyluS, Sept. c. Thebas, in which Polynices comes with nn Argi-ve· army

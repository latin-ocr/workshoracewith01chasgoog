end to her inti-ignes, for she is poor and ready to drop into her grave.

stammana—Fut a s‘top to thy intr-igueS, for thou art old and poor.
'What hecometh thy daughter becometh not thee, Chloris. She may go ,und
besiege the young men's doors: she is in love, and cannot help it. But do
thou go spin ; music and flowers and wine are not for thee. ’

Hermen here dwells on his favorite theme, -· contentment and modera-
tion‚ —which he is able to illustrate by the example of Maecenas (v, 20), as
well as his own. The mischievous influence of gold is illustrated by the
stories of Danae and otherS, and Horace describes his own coutentment with

his humble but independent condition.

Anounnn'r.—-A stout prison and savage watch-dogs might have kept
‘Danae from harm ; but Jove and Venus smiled, for the knew that. the god
need but change himself to gold, and the way would clear before him.
Gold penetrates through guard33 gold shall burst rocks3 thereby fell the
house of Amphiaraus3 thereby the Macedonian won citios, thereby stem
‚admit-als are ensnared. And as it groWS, the ,desire for more grows too.
A high estate I dread. Maecenas, thou good knight‚ the more a man denies
himself, the more the gods. will give him. I fly from the rich to the con-

· tentcd, and am more independent than any poor rich man in the world. My
stream, and my little wood, and my trusty field, are a happier portion than
all Africa. I have no honey of Calabria, nor wine of Formiae‚ nor Gauiish
fleece, yet poverty doth not pineh me ; and if I wanted more, thou art ready
to ive it. . ·

had all Lydia and Phrygia for my own. who ask much, laek much. · It
is well with him who has enough.

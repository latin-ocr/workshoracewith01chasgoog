fering from famine, the king, Αιγε, divided the people into two equal parts, of
whom one remained at home, and the other took ship and made the coast of
Etruria, and there settled, under Tyrrhenus, the son of Atys. Horace and
Vir-gil (Aen. ii. 781) both adopted this story, which was familiar to men of
learning, and perhaps ' believed by many. ‘ Lydorum quidquid‚’ ⁴ all the

6. liberfflio patre >natum] The difference between ‘ libertus ' and ‘ liberti-
nus ⁹ is, that the latter expresscd a man who had been mimumitted, the for-
mer-,a freedman in his relation to the master who had given him. his freedom.
The son of a ‘ libertinu8,’ born after his futhei-'s manumission, and all other

9. Ante potestaten 7111ὶί- Horace here follows the legend which made ·
Servius Tullius the son o a slave-girl, and himself a slave in the palaee of
'King Tarquinius (see Livy, i. 39). On this account his reign was ignole
while in true nobility it was surpassed by none of the others. Another legend

Valerius Publicola, the colleague of Brutus after the expulsion of the kings.
The family of Laevinus was another distinguished branch os the same gens.
The Laevmus in the text is said to have been a man of abandoned character,
so bad that even the populace, who were not easily deterred from confsi-ung
their honors upon the viciouS‚ could not be prevailed on by admiration of his

set a bad mark upon, to brand, and was technically applied to «the censors

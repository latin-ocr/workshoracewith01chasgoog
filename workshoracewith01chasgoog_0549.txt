Emensus. -- Boon ⁶1. , 529

1. Villiae silvarum] The ‘ villicus ' was one of the principal slaves iu the
‘familia rustica,’ who-had the superintendence of a man s farm and ‘ villa rus-
tica? He collected his rentS, looked after his slave3‚ and had charge of every-
thiug but the cattle, of which there 'was a separate superintendent. Horace
says his woods and fields restored him to himself ; that is, they gave him
liberty and enjoyment of life.

2. habitatum quinque focis] ‘ Focis ² is put for ‘families.' Horace says
there lived on bis estate five familie8‚ the heads of which were good men,
who went up from time to time to the neighboring town of Varia. Some
suppose they were ‘coloni’ (C. ii. 14. 11, n.), lessees who farmed different

· parts of the estate. Varia was thjrty miles from Rome, and ten from Tibur,
on the Via Valeria. It was four miles from Horace’s farm. Its modern
name is Vico Varo.

5. an rea] His land. ‘ Praedia’ were ‘rcs mancipi?⁴ , -

6. Lamiae] See Introd. to C. ’ii. 17. ‘Insolabiliter' occurs nowhere else.

9. rumpere claustra] At the end of the Circus were stalls (‘ carceres ')‚ in ·
which the chariots remained till the race was ready to begin. They were
theu brought out, and ranged side by side behind a rope called ‘ alba linea’
or ‘ calx‚’ which was stretchcd across the course, and formed a bari-ier, be-
yond which the chariots could not advance till the signal was given and the
rope withdrawn. It is from this obstruction, or from the ‘ carcere8‚' that the
metaphor in the text istaken.

13. se non-e uyit unquam] Compare C. ii. 16. 19.

14. Tu ἀπίκας] He had been one of the lowest slaveS, used for all
manner of work in the ‘familia urbana-,² and by his pitiful countenance (for
he was afraid perhaps to speak) had shown how much he wished to be de·
livered from that condition, and to be sent to work on the farm, though that
*i'vffieffieffie‘ffiffiidffssss “ftbssssssiffieffffpffsl'imffl'fflssffiissii s, {iigdiisssshssss
was the name for the lowest sort of slave, both in the town and country es-

tablishment. It is derived from ‘medius,' from his standing in the midst‚ ,

and being at every one’s call.
tacita prece] See Ep . i. 16. 59, n.
18. eo disconvenit] ‘ ’ἳό this comcs the difference between me and you.’
19. tesca] ‘ Tesca’ means any rough wilderncss. It is a rare word.

21. uncta popina As to ‘popina’ (which Horace calls ‘uncta,' because .

·of the greas 'vian s cooked them), see S. ii. 4. 62, n.

23. Auqu us isteseret] Horace writes as if he were repeating the contempt-
uous lang-uage of the villicus. ‘ That little nook of yours would produce
pepper and frankincense‘ (which of course was impossible) sooner than
grapes.’ The grapes grown on the farm hc did not think worthy of the
name. That Horace made his own wine, and that it was· not too bad to put
before MaecenaS, we know from C. i. 20. Pepper the ‚ancients must have
obtained, through some channel, from India. ‘Thus’ or “tus olibanum,’ .
xwhich is a gum-resin, extractcd from a ‘trec called now the Boswellia Thuri-
fera, was brought chiefly from Arabia. See Virgil (Georg. i. 57): “ India
mittit ebur, molles sua tura Sabaei.” .

25. meretrix tibicina‚] The ‘ tibia ’ was played by women as well as men,
and chiefly by women at mcaIS.

26. ettamen αγρεε] This is said with a sort of mock compassion: ‘And
yet, poor man! (though you have none of these comforts to help you on

our way‚) you have to go on turning up the rough soil, feeding the oxen,
{boking out for floodS, and all that! ‘Jampridem non tacta' implies that
Horace’s property had been neglectcd‘ before it came into his possession.

· Maecenas had probahl never reside-d there, and perhaps he had not been

long owner of it when 4e5gave ii. to Horace. One of the duties the ‘ villicus ’ ’

100. „Iudaeus Apella] The majority of the Jews at Rome were fieedmens
and ‘ Apelln’ wae- a common name for ‘ libertini! Their ereed was a su eit--
stition of the most contemptible kind, in the eyes of a Romam and-a· ew-
was only another name for a credulous fooi. The Jews netumed their eon-
tempt with hatred, which showed itself in a turbulent spirit that made them
vei-'y troublesome. Horace intimante thaz he had learnt from the school of
Epicurus that the gods were too happy to mind the small afflirs of thie
world, which he expresses in the words of Lucretius (vi. 57): “Ram benet
qui didieem deos securum agere aevnm.'’ See C. i. 34. 2, n.‚ and the Intro-
duction to that Ode. ·

. 104. Brundisium] From this abrupt conclusion, we may judge that Horace·
had got tired of his Journal as well as his journe . Brundisium (Brindisi)
was for centuries the most important town· on εἷθ’ eastern coast of Italy,
ehiefly through the convenience of its position for communicating with
Groeee, and the excellence of its harborss Its distance smm. F ntia was
thirty-five miles. There was a station named Speluncas (now Εἰ otta Rosa}
midway‚ where the party ma have halted one night, and which Horace,
having nothing he enred to tel us about it, has passed over in silence.

 

SATIRE vL

In addition to the’obloqtry brought upon him by his Satn-ee, Horae& astent
his intimacy with- Maecenas had begun to be known, had to meet the envy
such good fortune was sure to excite. His birth- wonld- flimish ahandie for
the envious, and he was probably called an upstart‚ and har& names o? that
sort. In this Satn-e, which is nothing· but an epist—ie to Maecenas, he spnms
the idea of his birth being· any objectioni to him5 while, ατ· the same time, he*
*argues sensibly against men trying to get beyond then-*own legitimam spuere„
and nimiu-g at honore which are only attended· with inconveniean fatigue,
and ill-will. This Satire, bflsides the good sense and· good-feeling it contain3‚.
is valna-blo as bearing· upon Horaee's fise.- His introduction to Maecenas is
told concisely‚ but ffiUy, and with: mach· pmpriety and modesty; and nothing
can be more plensing tizam the filiai affection and gratitude shown in those
parts that relate to his father, and the ed acation lte gave him. He takes
pleneme in referring whateveir ments he might heve· to- this good pauent, as·-
he did in the fourth Satire.

The Satire, then, may besupposed to have been· written chieflyibt‘ vthe pur-
pose· of ilisaoeming· emy, by showing the modesty of the· anthol-’s metensium, ·
and the circumstances that led to his‘ intimacy with Maecenas.. The view& of

- public life which it eontains wem no doubt sineere, and tite daily romine

described at the end was better suited to Homce’s· habit 0ss mind· than the’
fiztigues- and anxieties of office. >There is not the least appearance inan-y of
his writings of his having· been spoiled by his good fortune and by hie intel·-
eourse, on terme of rare familiarity, with Angustus, Meet-enne, and othem;
and probably malignity never attacked any one less ‹feserving of atmck than
Horace.

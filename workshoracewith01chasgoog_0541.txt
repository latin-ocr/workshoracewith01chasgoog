for such an intimate friend, if-he could have ventui-ed to dor so; but the char·
aeter of Tiberius did not admit of warmth, and he would not have responded
to any very earnest eulogy. Horace therefore satisfies himself with merely
naming his friend, and excusing his own boldness in doing so. ’

1. nimirum] ‘ of course,’ it would be strange isit were otherwise. Horace
sometimes uses the word seriously‚ sometimes ironically, as 111 S. ii. 2. 1063
3. 120. Η6 says, ‘ Of course Septimius knows my- influence with you better
than anybody else does (.‘ unus,’ see S. ii. 6. 57, n.)‚ and better than I do my-
self, and thinks that I stand to you in- the relation of an intimate friend, or
116 would not press me for an introduction.' There is about the same amount
of ironical meaning in ‘scilicet’ (v. 3) as in ‘nimirum.' ‘Tradere’ is the
usual word for introductione. (S. i. 9. 47.)

4. Diqnum mente domoque] Tacitus sa s of Tiberius, that his genuine char-

, acter did not come out fully till after e fall of Sejanus. At this time he

was about twenty-two years of age, but even now was reserved and unpleas-
ant iu his manners, so much so that even Augustus could hardly be cheerful
in his compan ·. Horace speaks well of him, not only here, when 116 is writ- ·
ing to himsel , but in Epp. ii. 2. 1, written robably at a later time, to his
friend Julius Florus, The fourteenth Ode o the fourth Book was written 111
honor of his 6116666666, but there no great amount of warmth is shown in his
favor. ‘Domo’·means his family. Tiberius was 1116 son of Τ. Claudius
Nero, and the Nerones belonged to the patrician gens Claudia, which num-
bered many consuls and other high magistrates, -from the first establishment
of the family in Β. 6. 504. The were of Sabine origin.

5. Munere cum sanyr· This p rase is like ‘officium facio ' below (Epp. 17.
21). 11 means to disc arge the duties of friendship, but generally expresses
the relation of an inferior to, 0116 above him in rank, and sometimes is used ·

⁴»in a had sense, to signify servility.

6. valdius] This comparative occurs again, in A'. P. 321 τ “valdius ob·
lectat 1110111116111.υ - -

11. remis ad urbanae descendi praemia] ‘ Urbanae frontis ’ seems to
:mean au ‘impudent front,' such'as one who had been bred in cities might
show· ‘ Praemia' seems to be opposed to ‘ opprobria,’ 61111 ‘descendere ' is
commonly used in ,connection with the arena. Horace may mean (taking
his metaphor from this source), that, to avoid the discredit of a greater fault,
he has resolved to win the crown or prize of impudence‚ or something of that ·
sort.

13. Scribe tui qreyis] This construction with the genitive is more common
in Greek. It occurs m C. iii. 13. 13 : “ Fies nobilium tu quoque fontium.”
As to ‘ fortem bonumque,’ see C. iv. 4. 29, n.

EPISTLE X.

Tine Ep'istle is addressed to Fuscus Aristius, whose name appears in C. i.
223 S. i. 9. 61 ; 10. 83. For such particulare as can be stated about him, see

·the Introduction 101116 above Ode. It appears that his habits inclined him .

to a town life. He was making mone m some way, and he was associated
with all Horace's literary and other ricnds. Horace praises the freedom,
the natural beautieS‚ and the healthiness of the country, and shows that they
are natural to men’s tastes, from the attempts thcy make to get trees in their
town houses, and a prospect over the fields. He follows this up with a few,

⁸ miscellaneous remarks on the pursuit of wealth, how it blinds the eyes to the

distinction between “¹²22 ²¹{and falsehood‚ and how prosperity only makes ad«

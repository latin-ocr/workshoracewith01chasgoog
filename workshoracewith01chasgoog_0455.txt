107.) ‘Lapis albus ' was a small side-table of white marble. The wealthy
Romans had a great variety of tables of the handsomest sort in their ‹lining-
rooms, for exhibiting their plate. ,( See beloW, S. 2. 4, n.; and above, S. 3.
¹1³, n.) All the plate. Horace hed to show was two eups and a cyathus (C.
iii. 19. 12), and these it is probable were usually empty. The ‘ edzinus ' is a
vessel nowhere else mentioned by that name, and is variously· interpreted as
. a salt-cellar (in the shape of an ‘ echinus ’ or sea-hedgehog), a glass bottle, a
leather bettio, and a wooden bowl ‘m which to wash the en s. ‘ Paterae ’
were broad, flat, sauoer-shaped cupS, and were much used in ’ 'ons. ‘ Gut-
tns ' was a long, thiu-necked botrie, from which wine or oil was potu-ed very
slowly, drop by drop. It was also used in libations, and these two vessels,
as here joined, have refer-enee to the practice of offer-ing a libation at every
meai to the Lares. See C. iv. 5. 34, n. These were of the commoneat ean-dien-
ware which came from Campania. See S. ii. 3. 144.

120. amadus Marsya,] Horace says he goes to bed without the nervons
feeling that he must be' up early to go to the Forum, where a statne of Mar-
syas was eneeoed near the Rostra. Marsyas was a fabulons person, who was
said to have challenged Apollo to play the ly'rc against his flute. Apollo,
having gained the victory, caused Marsyas to be flayed alive. Marsyas or
Silenus was the symbol of a city having the Jus Italicum, one part of which

was a fiee constitution of its own. It would therefore appear m the Forum Ι

as the symbol of free jurisdiction. The onl representations of Marsyas that
romain, exhibit him either in the agony o punishment, or in the suspense
that preceded it. Wherefore “ a Marsyas conntenance '’ was synonymous
with dejectiori aad ill-hamon and Horace seems to indicate that his face was
distorted, and ascribes it hnmomnsly t'o his detestationi of the younger No·
vine, who is said to have been a usurer.

Horace was tired with his game, he went to the public batbs to bathe, which
was usual after laying, and. then took a light luncheon (see above, S. 5. 25,

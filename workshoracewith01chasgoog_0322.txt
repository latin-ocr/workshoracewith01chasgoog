oDE ΞΠ.

Wuo Postumus was, or whether it is a real name, is uncertain. The sub-
ject of the Ode isx the certainty of death, and it ends with a hint upon the folly

of hoarding.

Anounaxr.—Ti1ne is slipping away, PostumuS, and piety will not re·
tard the approach of or death. “ No sacrifices will propitiato Pluto, who
keeps even the giantsaggryon and Tityos beyond that stream which all must
erOSS, even though we expose not ourselves to the dangers of war, the sea,
and climate. Thou must leave home, wife, and all thou hast, and thino heir

will squander what thouhast boarded.

1. fuqaces] ‘ fleeting.’

4. indomitae] The Greek ἆδᾶμαστος.

’ 5. trecenis quotquot eunt dies] ‘ three hundred every day!

6. illacrima'bilem] Here this word is used in an active sense. It is used
passively in C. iv. 92‘26: “ Omnes illacritbnabiles ufgenssur'„·· See note on C.

tricorporis umbrae ’³ (Aen. vi. 289). He was a mythical king of the island
Erytheia (Gades), slain by Hercules (C. iii. 14. 1). Tityos was a giant who,
for attempting to violate the goddess Artemis. was killed by Apollo and. cast
into TartaruS, where vultures devoured his liver (C. iii. 4. 773 iv. 6. 2).

8. tristi Compesct‘t tandm] This is Virgil’s description (Aen. vi. 438),—

“ Tristique palus inamabilis unda “
Alligat et novies Styx interfusa coercet,’' —

which is repeated from Georg. iv. 479. Sophocles (Electra, 137) calls it

πάγκοινον λίμναν.
9. scilicet] This is in reality a verb, “you may know,' ‘ you may be sure!
Itis used as an adverb, ‘ assuredly,' sometimes in a serious- sense (as here),

sometimes in an ironica? . ·
10. Quicu’nque terrae η”ῐιιηενε vaccinium] This expresses the words of Homer,

ὃὲ θνητός τ εἴη καὶ ἔδοι Δημήτερος ἀκτῆν (ΙΙ. xiii. 322), οἳ ἀρούρης καρπὸν
ἕ ουσι 11. vi. 142 .

11. rives] Thig is Horace’s usual word for the rich, as observed on C. i.
4. 14. ‘ Colonus ' was the lessee of a farm, the owner of which was called.
‘dominus' in res eet to that property. ⁸ Regesss therefore, are ‘domini.’
A ‘colonus ' mig t be rich and the tenant of a large farm; but Horace re-
fers to the poorer sort here and in C. i. 35. 6. · Inops ² he uses sometimes in
an extreme, sometimes in a qualified sense of want, but more generally the
latter, as he does ‘pauper,’ C. i. 1. 18, n. The opposition is between
high and low, and'the differenee is one of position, as in the third Ode of
this book (v. 21, sqq.). “ The small and great are there. and the servant
is free from his master.'’ (Job iii. 19.) This seems to express Horaee's
mela5nmbgrtu⁸tm per auctuumos nocentem] See S. ii. 6. 18, n. With ‘ nocentem'
connect ‘ Corporibus!

18. Cocytos] This was the name of a tributary of the river Acheron in
Thesprotia, a part of Epirus. For some reason, these rivers came to be placed
in TartaruS, and the Styx was added to them as a third. The language of
the text expresses very well the character an infernal stream might be ex-

ected to wear. ’- · ·
P Danai yenus] ‘the family (or children) os Danaus.³ The punishment of
the fifty daughters of Danaus is referred to in C. iii. 11.

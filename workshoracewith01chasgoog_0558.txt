his own folly in parading them.

52. Brundisium comes aut Surrentum] To Brundisium a man might go on
business; to Surrentum (Sorrento) for the climate and scenery, which are
still very healthy and beautiful. 'Surrentum was made a Roman colony
about this time. We do not hear much of it as a place of resort‚ though
from this passage we may infer that it was one of the pleasant spots on the
Campanian coast to which the wealthy Romans went for change of air. Its
wines were celebrated⁴ (see Epp. 15. 16, n.). In mentioning Brundisium,
Horace may have been thinking of his journey withMaecenas. He sayS, if

acumina’ means ‘ the hackneyed tricks.’ ’ ‘

59. Fracto cmre planum,] The Romans adopted the Greek word πλάνος
for a vagabond and impostor. As to ‘plurima,’ see C. i. 7. 8, 11. Horace
makes the man swear by the Egyptian Osiris, as if that were tho most sacred
of oaths. Among other new superstit‘mns, the worship of Isis had 110011
lately introduced into Rome. Efforts were made, from time to time, to put
it down, and Augustus forbade its being exercised in the city. But under
later emperors it became established, with the eneouragement of the govern
ment, in conjunction with that of Serapis. Osiris was not worshipped sep
rately, but shared, perhap8, the reverence paid to his wife (Isis).

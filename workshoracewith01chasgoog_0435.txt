his own language (v, 20), that he was goodsstempered, notwithstanding his
satirical vein (v. 53), and again that he was very unreserved and fmnk (S. ii.
1. 30-34)- The fragments of Lucilius that have come down to us am too
short to form a very accurate opinion u ion, but in some points, at least, (such
as the absurd mixture of Greek and imin) they bear out Horace's state-
ments.
’ 7. Mutat& tantum pedibus] The writings of Lucilius appear to have been
*very early divide’d by the grammar-iaus into thirty books, of whichtwo thirds
were written in hexamete: verse, and the rest m the iambic and trochaie
measures. That Lucilius imitated the eomedians in all but their mensures,
cannot be truie. The character of their plays could not be transferred to
satirical poema like his, though some of their features might suit, as their
coamness and personalities.

8·- ἔζευκται-πανὺ, ‘ Emunctae naris' is one who has his nose well wiped‚
{md is ἑὴὲτεῶτιθ 130 d veller- Phaedrus explains it in his description of AEsop

1. iii. , v. 4 :— ,
· “Aesopus ibi stans naris emunctae senex,
Natura nunqnam verba cni poterit dare.” -

‘Emungere’ is used by the comio writers for .‘ cheating,’ as among other
laces'1see A. P. 238) m the fragment from the Epiclerus of Caecilius quoted
y Cicero de Am. 26. “To wipe a. man's nose for him, is to imply that he
is a driveller who cannotdo it for himself, and hence it means to ‘outwit'
and to -‘cheat’ him.” (Long in loco). Others explain ‘emunctae naris ' as
⁴ keen-scented‚’ like a bound, which is wrong.

10. versus dictalat] See S. 10. 92, n. The words ‘stans 'pede in uno'
mean with the utmost facility, or ¹ standing at ease,' as we might say. Others
explain ‘stans pedein uno' to mean within the time a man could stand on

Δ one foot- The other is right„

“’ 11. Cumflaeret lutulentus] ‘Lutulentus' combines two notions‚ dirtiness
and obscurity. Ludlius may have imitated the obscenity of the old eome-
dians ; and in this, as in other respects, his verse may have been like a mud-
dy stream. The word, no doubt, comprehends defects of taste as well as
st le. .

y12. piqer scribmdi fen-e laborem,] ‘Piger ferre’ is a. Greek construction,
common in the Odes, but not so in the language of the Satires. (See C. i.
1. 18, n.) In C. iv, 14. 22, we have ‘ impiger ¹· in the same construction.

14. Crispinus minimo] See S. i. l. 120, n. ‘Minimo me provocat,' ‘he
offers me‘the greatest odds,' literally, ‘he challenges me at the smallest
amount' to be staked on my side, while he puts down a large one on his.
The mention of the negligent way in which Lucilius wrote, leads on‘to the
mention of small poets of the day, Crispinus and Fannius. See Introduc-
tion. ·

15. Accipiam subulas ‚·]. This is nothing more than a polite challenge to
see which could write most verses in a given tinus. ‘ 'sake tablets if you
plesse, and Ι will take them too.'’ The omission of the personal pronoun
before ‘accipiam ' to express antithesis, is nothing in familiar talk, where
there could be no mistake. ‘ Custodes ² are umpires to see that there is no
foul la .

18? rgro et perpauca mnemia] ‘ The gods have done me a kindness in
making me of a poor and unpretendiug disposition, that speaks but seldom,
{ng-very little at a time! This is Horace’s reply to the challenge, which he

e mes.

19. At tu conclusas] Persius imitates this, S. v. 10.

21. Beatus Fannr‘us] This Fannius is spoken of in another place (S. i. 10.
80) as a contemptible person, and a parasite of Hermogenes Tigellius (S. 3.
129, n.).· It appears probable, from Horace's ποι-(15, that he had his admir-

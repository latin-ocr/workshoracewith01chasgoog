'17 . Seu Libra] What Horace thought of astrology , may be collected
from c.i.11. He introduces a little of it here to entertain his friend,
showing, at the same time, but little care or knowledge of the sulficct, and
rather a contempt for it. He says whatever the constellation may have been
under which he was born, whether Libra, Scorpio, or Capricornus, his star
no doubt coincided with that of MaecenaS, 'for that their sortuncs were one.

20. Capricornus] The sun enters this constellation in the winter. It is,
therefore charged with the storms that then occur, and is called the tyrant
of the western ware, as Notus ‘is called·the lord of the Hadriatic (C. i.

23.) resulqens] Shining in opposition, so as to counteract his influcnces.
Those who were born when Saturn was visible were supposed to be liable to
all manner of ills. But the star of Jupiter, if it shone at the same time,
would destroy the power of Saturn.

kind is not easily reduced to rule; but it seems to coi-respond to the Greek

construction of ἄν with the indicative. When the condition is not suffimen,

ODE XVIII.

Tms Ode, which deals with Horaee’s favorite subjecte, the levelling·
power of death, and the vanity of wealth, and the schemes of the wealthy,
is >dedicated to no particular friend. It is like C. iii. 24. ·

Artemam-rr. -No gold in my roof, no marble in my hall, no palace have
1, nor female clients to serve me; but I have honesty and understanding,
and, though I be poor, I am courted by the rich : what more should I ask
os the gods or my friend, content with my single Sabine estate<² Dnys are
passing on, and, though ready to drop into thy grave, thou art building and
stretching thy borders, and tcaring iip the landmarks of thy client, and
driving him from his home. But to what purpose is this ’ἐ To Iladcs thou
must go in the end: the ea‘rth opens to rich and poor; Prometheus the
crafty, and Tantalus the proud, they cannot escape; and the poor man
finds in death· a release from his tons, whether he seek it or not.

’101. at vivan Maenim 9] The construction is the same as “discinctus aut
perdam nepos '' (Epod. i. 34), where it has been proposed to insert ‘ut ' be-
fore ‘ nepos) Maenius and Nomentanus appear to have been squanderers of
money, and good livere, accordIng to the obvious meaning of this passage.
They are united again in S. i. 8. 11, ii. 1. 21, where the former ap ars under
=the ,name Pantolabns‚ one who lays his hands on 'anything e can get
(πάντα λαβών), or- borrows mone from any one who will lend it. He spent
his money and turned parasite. th Maenius and Nomentanus are names
used by Lucilius for characters of the same kind, and Horace may very prob-
ably have only horrowed the names to represent some livin characters,
whom he. does not ehoose to point out by their own names. omentanus
was the name of one of the guests at the dinner of Nasidienus (S. ii. 8. 25).
He appears again, S. ii. 3. 224, sqq. '

103. montibu adversis componens .·] These words go together, ⁸ to bn‘ng
face to face, and compare or match! . ·

104. vappam] ‘Vappa,' wine which has t flat and sour, expresses a
worn-out debatrehee: ‘ nebulo‚' a frivolous fel ow, light as a mist (· nebula ’).

105. Tanain· -- socerumque Viselli] The Scholiast says that Horace has
conveyed under these names a well-known Greek proverb. What thedis-
tinction between thern may have been, is unknown.

108. nemo ut avarus] ⁴ I return to that point from which 1 have dig-ressed,
»how that no covetous man is satisfied with himself) The reading is not cer·
-tai-n, and the hiatus is unusual. Horace qualifies the general a'ssertion he
made at the outset, by limiting his remark to the avarieions. See note on v.

283 and on ‘lauden' see v. 3. -

114. Ue, quum carceribus] These lines are a little like the last three verses
of Virgil's first Georgic. '

2119. Cedat ati conviva mur-‚J These aie⁴ so like the words of Lucretius

· ⁵(iii. 951), that perhaps Horace remembered them when >he wrote, —

“ Cur non ut plenus vitae conviva recedis,

Aequo animoque capis securam, stulte, quietem ’ἐ ”
. 120. Crispini scrinia lippi} We know nothing about Crispinus. The fer-
-tility of his pen has profited him nothing. He was more anxious to write
·much than to write well. See S. i. 4. 14, s q. Crispinus appears in the
third Satire of this book (v. 139), where he is t e only attendant of the would-
bq ‘rex.' He appears again in S. ii. 7. 45. ‘Lippi’ is used for mental

SATIRE 11.

Tms Satire, the coar-sest of all written by Horace, seems to have been sug-
gested by the death of TigelliuS, a celebrated musician of· the time. It is
directed against the tendency of· men to run into extremes, and to pass from
one extreme to the other. Illustrations of· this subject are drawn from the
socia} ,life of Rome. The ideas and the language are marked by a grossness

which is unusual with Horace. ’

 

SATIRE 111.

· Tim last Satire was, as has been said, written on the death of one Tigel-
lius, an eminent musician, a native of Sardinia, and a friend of Julius Caesar.

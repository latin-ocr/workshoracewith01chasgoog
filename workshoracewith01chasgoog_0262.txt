Medus for' Medicus, is the only form Horace uses. · The country of the
Marsi, east of Rome, Umbria, and Lucania were au famous for boam, being

was a sort of ngeolet. W en it is used in- the plural (as here, C. iv. 15. 30,
Epod. ix. 5), it has reference to -two os these instrumente playcd by one per-
son. Their pitch was different, the low-pitehed tibia being called ‘ dexnal
, because it was held in the right hand, and the high-pitched ‘ sinistra’ be-

cause it was held in the left. Euterpe, the Muse, was said to have invented
the ‘ tibia,’ and she especially presided over music. Polyhymnia, or Polym-

ODE' ΙΙ.

Tms Ode seems to have been written on the return of Angustus 00 Reme,
after the taking of Alexandria, when the civil ware were brought to §close
and the temple of Janus was shut, B. c. 29. Horace here urges Augustus
to take upon himself the task of reducin to order the clemente of the state,
which so many years of civil war had &town into confusion, and he does
so in the ibllowing manner. He refers to the prodigies at Julius Caesar’s
death, as evidences of the divine wrath for the guilt of the civil wars. He
then invokes one god aster another to eome and restore the state, and finally
fixes upon Mercury, whom he entreats to take upon himself the form of a
man, and not. to leave the earth till he has accomplished his mission and
9⁰¹X¹⁰⁶red the enemies of Rome. The man whose form Mercury is to take
is u ustus.. ·

1f is Ode is read with C. ii. 15, and the others mentioned in the intro-
duction to that Ode, the feeling with which Horace entered into the missinn

of Augustus es the reformet will be better understood.

ODES.—-BOOK Ι. ·

ODE Ι.

Tms Ode was probably written as a dedication to Maecenas of the three
first bookS, when they were collectively ublished, probably in the sorty-
second year of Horaee's age, B. c. 24. e says that different men have
different tastes; the Greek loves the Olympio games, the Roman to get
place or money ; one is quiet, another restless, and so on; while he only
loves the lyre, and seeks to be ranked by Maeeenas among lyrie poets.

Anounnuw. —Maeeena3‚ my roteetor, my pride, various are the aims of
men. The Greek seeks glory rom the y raee; the lords of the world are
supremel happy, one in the honcffl of the state, the other in his well-filled
hams· he farmer will not plough the seas; the merchant is restless on
land. One man loves his ease and his wine ; another, the camp and the din
of wal-3 while the huntsman braves all west-hers for his s ort. My glory is
in the ivy erown, my delight to retire to the groves witfi the nymphs and.
the satyra, where my muse breathes the flute or strikes the lyre. Placed
by thee among the lyrie choir, 1 shall lift my head to the skies.

of Etruria, and up to a late period possessed of mfluence in the Etrurian
town of Areti'um‚ whence they were expelled by their own citizens Ec. 300.

3. Sunt quos] The Greeks say ἔστιν οὕς. The indicative is used with
‘sunt‚' or ‘est qui,’ when particular persons are alluded to, as here the
Greeks in opposition to the Romans. So Epp. ii. 2. 182: “Argentum—
sunt qui non habeant, est qui non curat habere‚” where, by the latter, is

distinetly indicated the wise man. Φ Here Horaee alludes to the Greeks of ’

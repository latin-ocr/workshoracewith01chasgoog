. Scilicet, atquc Ossae frondosum imponere ‘Olympumj’
whe're ‘ frondosum ’ explains Ilorace’s ‘ opaco! Ovid inverts the order, and
puts Pelion uppermost, as Horace does :—
“ Ignibus Ossa novis et Pelion altior Ossa
Arsit.'’ (Fast. iii. 441.) ·

In the fifth book of the Fasti (v. 35, sqq.)‚ he attributes to the hundred-handed

iants (v. 69) the exploit which the oldest legend assigns to the Aloidae.
{hese variations are ‘only worth noticing as they help to show that the Ro-
mans set little value by these storics¹ and only used them as ornaments of
poetry; 'and to prevent students from wasting theu· time in attempting to

reconcile state-ments which are 'not reconcilable. -·— Typhoeus (Tvssmebc)
wari-cd with Zeus on liis own account„ Ile belonged neither to the itanes
nor the Gigantes. Mimas and Rhoetus were os the Gigantes. Porphyrion]
and Enceladus were of the same family - .

’ 57. sonantem Palladis aeyida] The ⁴ aegis ' was tho skin of the goat Amal-¹
t'hea, the nurse of ZeuS‚ and is said to have been worn by him first in these
wars with the Gigantes. It is occasionally found in ancient representations
of Jupiter, but more commonly of Minerva. '1⁵0 account for the epithet ⁴ so·
hantem,’ we must understand that the ‘aegis ' was taken to represent, not

o'nly the goat-skin folded over the breast, but also a shield ( 11. xv. 229, sqq.y‚· ·

and a mc‘tal breastplate‚ either of which it may signify here. Homer repre·
sents both A ›ollo and. Pallas as wearing their father’s ‘aegia’

58. aridus This means ¹ avidus pugnac‚' as in Virg. (Aen. xii. 430),
“Ille avidus pu ae suras incluserat auro.'’ Tacitus puts the word abso·
lutely (Anu. i. 5 ), “ Caesar 'avidas legiones quatuor in cuneos dispertit&
In enumerating the principal gods who assisted Zeus in the battle, Horace
means to say that, although they were present, it was Pallas to whom the vic-·
tory wls mainly owing. See Introduction. ‘ Hine —hinc ’ ; ⁴ in one place -·- .

· 59. matrona June] The Greek Here was commonly represented united, orl
artly so. The Roman Juno was always elad as a matron from head to foot.
{let favorite character was Juno Matrona or Romana, which meant the same -
thirlizg. Her introduction‚ therefore,·under this title, is meant as a eompliment
to ome. v , · ·
’ 61. Qui rore puro] The description of Apollo combines his various pla-ees
of abode. Castalia was a. fountain on Parnassus, ‘ Lyciae dumeta’ are
woods about Patara, a town in Lycia, where Apollo passed six months of the
year, as he passed the other six at Delos, which place Horace means by ‘na-

talem silvam,’ i. e. the woods on Mount Cynthus. See Herod. i. 182. ’

sisting of three brotherS, GyaS, CottuS‚ and Briareus or AEgaeon, distinguished
from the rest by havin each of them a hundred arms. Most accounts repre·
sent these brothers as elping Zeus Horace follows a different legend, and ⁵
so does Virgil (Aen. x. 565, sqq). -. ,

70. intem-ae] -‘ Integer ’ is equivalcnt to ‘ intactuS,’ and involves the same
mot (see above, C in. 2. 18, n.)., ι

71. Tentalor Orion] ⁴ Tentator ’ is not elsewhere used for a seducet. It is
taken from the Greek πειρὰν. The story of Orion is told in a variety of ways.
Here it is that he tried to seducc Artemis, and that she shot him with an ar·

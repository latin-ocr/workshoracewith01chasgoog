‚the river Heles or Eleos (Alento). Salernum in Ompania was situated at

Thence to Velia, about twenty miles, there was no Roman mad. ·

Baias] The atmosphere of Baiae appears to have been clear, and the

lace atti-active. (1101000 calls it ‘liquidae‚’ C. iii..4. 24, and ‘amoenae,’

Horace had been in the habit of going to Baiae, as we may infer from his
connecting it with the Sabine hilis, Praenesoe, and Tibur, in C. iii. 4; but it
appears he was now advised to try a different treatment, and seek some
other climate. ‘Super-vacuus ' means ‘useless ' ; the place wonid do him

came into notice chiefly· through cui-ing him of a bad illness he conti-acted in
the Cantabrian expedition. Having found cold bathing successful with the
emperor, Musa-appears to have made that his general principle of treatment.
At any rate, he recommended it vo Horace, and he followed his advice, not
without reluctance, as it would seem from this Epistle. The death of Mar-
cellus may have contributed to making Baiae· nnpopular for a time, but it
soon recovered its character (see above, Epp. 1. 83). There are some frag-

now be thought a strong remedy even by hydropathists ; but it is one of

9. Clusinis Gabiosque] Clusium (Chiusi) was one of the chie'f towns of
Etruria, the capital of Porsenna, and the place where the ‘Gauls received that
insuit which led to their siege of Rome (Liv. v. 33). It was situated on the
Via Cassia, about one hundred miles' north of Rome. Strabo (v. 3) men-

tions several cold streams at this place, calle'd τὰ Ἀλβουλα, which were usc- ,

ful in many complaints both for bathing and drinking.

10. deversoria] See S. i. 5. 2, n. There was a branch of the Via Appia
at Sinuessa, leading to Cumae, called 1110 Via Domitian-113 but that, as tho
name shOWS, was not consti-acted at this time, angl probably the traveller
would have to continue along the Via Appia till he 001110 to Capua, from
whence the Via Campana went to Cumae to the right, and the Via Aquilia
went straight on to Salernum, and 1110 Appia branched off through Caudium
to Beneventum. (See S. i. 5. 50. 71.) This explains ‘laeva habena? Tho
horse would turn 10 1110 right as usual to go to Cumae (whence the road was
continued to the Lucrino Lake and to Bauli and Baiae, about four or five
miles from Cumae). . 0

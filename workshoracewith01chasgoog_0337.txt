‘⁸ Scilicet is superis labor est, ea cura quietos

40. Priam ——bustol Priam had no tomb, according· to Virgil's account
(Aen. ii. 557), but Horace assumes that he had one. No greater affront could
be supposed than is here desired. Electra represents AEgisthus as leaping ou

her father's grave intoxicated with wine (Eurip. Eleet. 326, sq.). Compare .

Epod. xvi. 10, sqq , and Il. iv. 177.

' 64. 00an me Jom‘s et sorore] Both Horace and virgil (Aen. i. 46) get

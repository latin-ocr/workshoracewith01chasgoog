EPISTLES. — ΒοοΚ 1. ⁰ 543

not to be blamed for imitating Archilochus in his measure and the structure
of his verse, for Alcaeus and Sappho (he says, and we must take his word for
it) did the same3 they tempered their Muse with the measure of Archilochus.
The iambics of Archilochus are imitated by Horace in the Epodes. Other
measures of his he has imitated in the Odes. There is little leit of Archi-
lochus but his iambics. The vigorous style of Sappho's fragments shows
the reason why Horace calls her ‘ mascula! See C. ii. 13. 24, n. ..

³ Verba loquor socianda chordis ”3
and 3. ,23 : “ Romanae fidicen lyrae.'' ‘ Hunc ' Orelli refers to AicaeuS,

It may refer to Archilochus, I do not feel certain about it. Foreellini only
mentions one other example of ‘immemoratus ’ from Ausonius· ‘ Ingenuis '
means ‘ candid ’ or ‘ uncorrupted.’ ,

35. inm-atus] He means that the reader is ungrateful who gets gratifica-
tion from his poems at home, and ’ yet abuses them abroad. ‘ Ingratus ⁹
belongs to the second clause as well as ‘ iniquus? The reason-Horace gives
is, that he does not go about seeking the good opinion of vulgar critice, giving·
'them dinners and ‚cast-off clothes, and so on, but keeps himself to the eom-
pany of respectable authors, listening to their writings and getting them to
listen to his own. The language is taken from the notion of canvassing for
votes at an election.

39. auditor etaltoe These words are reciproeal. The man who listens to
a. stupid recitation as his revenge when he recites in return. Here it is
meant in a good-humored way. J uvenal's first Satire begins, “ Semper ego
auditor tantum? nunquamne reponam ‘3³' As to the practice of recitation
among friends and in public, see C. ii. 1, Int.‚ and S. i. 4. 73, n.

40. Grammaticas ambire tribus] Those who made a profession of literature
were called ‘ literati‚' ‘ eruditi,' or ‘ grammatici) The last name was applied
principally to those who kept schools or gave Iecmres, of whom there were a

reat many at this time at Rom‘e. Inferior writers would give a good deal
ἔοι· their favorable opinion, which would heltheir books into demand 'among
their scholars. Horace calls them ‘ eritiei' elsewhere (A. P. 78). ‘Pulpi-
tum ' meant any raised platform from which speeehes were delivered. Here
it applies to that from which the teachers delivered their lectures.

41. Hinc illae lacrimae] This became a common way of speaking after
Terence (Andr. i. 1. 99): “Atat hoc illud est: Hinc illae lacrimae, haec
illa est misericordia.’' ·
⁶ 'Spissis indiqna theatris] ‘ Theatra ' here means any audience before whi'ch
recitations of this kind might take place, though the poetry of popular writers
was recited in the theatres by ‘ mimi ’ and ‘ mimae.'

43. Jovis auribus] This is the same sort of expression as S, ii. 6. 52: “deos
quoniam propius 'contingiS.'' ‘ Manat-e ' is not commonly used as a transitive
verb. In this construction we, find the like words, ‘ flere‚' ‘ pluere,' ‘ stillare‚'
‘rorare,' &c. The expressions ‘nugis,' ‘ poetica mella,’ ‘tibi pulcher,’ all
seem to apply rather to the l rical compositions than to the SatireS, and the
former appear to have been t e objeets of all this servile imitation.

b 45. naribus uti] See S. i. 6. 5, n., and Persius (i. 40) : “nimis uncis Nari-
us indul es.’'

47. dihgdia posca] This word occurs nowhere else. It means», in the first
instance, an interval allowed to gladiators between their contests. ‘ Iste
locus ' must mean the ‘ pulpita' or ‘ sp'wsa theatra’ above mentioned. It
seems as if the speaker meant to gain time, and, without‘declining the eon‘

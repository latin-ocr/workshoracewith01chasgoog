SATIRES.—-BOOK Ι.

SATIRE 1.

Tun pmfessed urpose of this satire, or that with which Horace seems to
have begun, may gathered from the first two lines. Discontent with the
condition that Providence had assigned them ; disappointment with the po-
sition many years' labor, and perhaps dishonesty‚ have gained them 3 envy of
their neighbors' circumstance8‚ even if they be worse than their own; dis-
satisfaction, in short, with what they have and me, and craving for something.
they have not and are not, -- these arc features common to the great majority,
of men. For this vice of discontent the Greeks had a comprehensive name,

ffiss'iffsse‘pssi'. Jffissffiffigffliz “fissssafiffffiffgffi3¹5.ff*{3¹3.2”?33?3333
of it, and that not the most comprehensive (see notes on vv. 28. 108). Avarico,
is the onl remon he assigns for the universal discsse, and any one will see
that here y he leaves many untouched who are as culpably restless as the
avariciouS, but notin their sordid way.

The Satire is put first in the order of this book, not as an introduction (of
which it bears no signs), but because it is addressed to Maecenas.

1. quam sibi sortem] See note on C. i. 9.14, as to '‘sors’ and ‘for-sl,
These two are opposed, as effect and cause, the condition and that which'
‘ roduces it. ‘ Fors ’ and ‘ratio ' are opposed as that which a man cannot.
elp,hand that which he carves out for himself. ‘ Fors ' is ‘ accident: ‘ ratio?

is ‘ c oice.

“ 3. laudet] This sense of ‘ laudare,' ‘felicem praedicare,’ μακαρίζειν, is
repeated below, v. 9, and in v. 109, where it occurs in combination with,
and as equivalent tc, ‘ probare? So Cicero (De Am. c. 7) says: “Ex quo,
illorum beata mors videtur, horum vita laudabili5.” , -

· landet diversa sequentes 5³³- This is briefly expressed, for ‘ sed quisque
laudet.’ In the transition rom negative to positive statementS, the positive
clement which is contained in the former is often carried on in the mind, so
as to affect the latter, as in those sentences which are couplcd by ‘ nec ’ and
“et,' οὔτε and τε. ‘ Nemo vivit’ is ‘ quisque non vivit? ‘Diversa’ indi-
cates, not merely different, but ‘ opposite ’ carcere. ,

4'. ‚qrave‘s annis] Virgil says (Aen. ix. 246): ‘inc annis gravis atque
animi maturus Aletes.'' And ‘gravis ’ is one of the communest words
applied to old age, as may be gathered from Cicero’s treatise De Senect.;
and βαρύς is equally common in the same connection. Horace, in his own
gampaignin& had undoubtedly heard many a veteran grumbling at his con-

ition. -

7. Quid enim, concurritur .·] See C. ii. 18.. 23, n.

horae Memento] ‘ Horae momento ' is a common phrase in Livy and -

other writers. Horace has below,- ⁴ puncto mobilis horae! ‘ Punctum’ is
perhaps a little more precise than ‘ momentum,’ which signifles the pmgrcss
of time, though conventionally its smallest division. Pliny draws a distinc-
tion· between them (Panegyr.¹ iv. c. 56) : “ Quod momentum, quod immo
temporis punctum aut beneficio* sterile aut vacnum laude ’ἒ ”

9. juris quramqtoe peritus] ‘Jurisperiti,' ‘judsconsultiss were persons who
expounded the law. Then· expositions were called ‘ responsa‚’ and they gave·⁴

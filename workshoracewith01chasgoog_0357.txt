Ε p. i. 14. 6). In two passages Juvenal alludes to the Lamiae as a family
ο distinction (8. iv. 154, and vi. 385). Tacitus (Ann. vi. 27), mentioning
the death of this Lamia, says his ‘ genus ' was ‘decorumst

Anounnnr.—AEliuS, ennobled with the blood of Lamus‚-for like all
the Lamias thou derivest thy birth from him who founded Formiae and ruled
on the banles of the LiriS‚—a storm is coming3 get in the wood while it is

2. Quando] The same as ‘quoniam' ‘since’ ,

4. memores —sastos,] These were the family records and genealo icS, not
the Fasti Consulares, in which only this Lamia would appear, and t at after
Horace wrote. He was consul A. ι). 3. The‘words occur again in C. iv.
14. 4: “Per titulos memoresque fastOS.'' ‘Fastos’ and ‘fastus ’ (ad and
4th declension) are both found. See Epp. ii. 1. 48, n.

5. ducis] What Horace says is nearly as follows: ‘ Since it is reported
the first Lamiae had their name from LamuS, and the same tradition has
come down through their successors in the annals of, the family, no doubt
you draw your origin from that noble source ’ ; —in which there is nothing
more than a little jocular irony, which would amuse Lamia, whether it
plcased his family pride or not. The poem, both Latin and Greek, osten
omit the personal pronoun, even when it is wanted for emphasiS, as herc and
in C. i. 1. 35, “ Quod si me lvricis vatibus iuscris‚” where Maeceuas is em·
phasis-any adaoessed; and in ὼ. iv. 2. 33.

6. Formiarum] See Introduction.

’ 7. Illuricae Litoribus] This means* the coast of Minturnae on the bordei-s
of Latium and Campania, where the nymph Marica, the mother of Latinae,
first king of Latiumfflvas worshipped.

8. Lirim] See C. i. 31. 7.

9. Late tyrannus] ‘ lord of a. wide domuin?

12. aquae—auqur] See below, C. iii. 27. 11¹), “Imbrium divina avis im·
minentum '’; and Ovid (Am. ii. 6. 34), “ pluviae graculus auctor aquae.'’

14. cras Genitem niero carabisll ‘Genium curare’ is a phrase not found
elsewhere. ‘ Placare' and ‘in algere ' are the usual words. Lamia was

 

going to keep holiday next day, on what occasion does not ap ar, but as it “

was usual to offer sacrifice to the Genius on birthdays, it may ave been his
birthday Lamia was going to keep. As to ‘ Genius,' see Epp. i. 7 94.

16. omn-um solatia] This construction, like “desine querelarum '' (C. ii.
9. 17), and other expressions there quoted, is similar to the Greek, πόνου

λελυμένας. On these constructions Prof. Key says (L. G. ἡ 940, and note) τ '

‚“ Occasionally verbs of removal or se ration have a genitive of the ‘ whence ¹

in old writers and in poctry.’' “T e legal lan here, as in so many

cases, retained traces of the old construction, as in ‘li rare tutelae.’ ’' “ Me

{mnium jam laborum levas '’‘ is a like construction quoted by Mr. Key from
antus.

ODE XVIII.

11· was usual to offer sacrifice to Faunus at the beginning of spring, though
the Faunalia did not take place till the Nones of December. <See C. i. 4.
11, and i. 17.) This Ode is an invocation to that deity, and· is very elegant,
especially the. picture of rustic security and cheerfulness in the last two

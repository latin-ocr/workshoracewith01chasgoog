¹ On some occasion Horace, having gone inmthe country-for change of air
on account of his health, at the beginning of- August, was tempted tantur
away the whole month3 and. as he had promised-Mamertae to fetui-nin a few
days, he had perhaps received a letter from his friend, r'emInding him df that
promise, and begging him to come beck. Moecenas was avaletud‘maiianr
· and had probably some of the quei-ulons selfishness that usually attende on

that condidon. 'We may infer ‚as much from that Ode (ii. 17) which begins, '

“ Cur me querelis exanimas tuis ’ἕ ” and hc very likely felt th‘e want of flon-

was sure Maecenas’s liberality was bestowed upon him ina genereus spirit,

and that he did not mean to compromise his independ'eucm for if he coniti· ,

suppose that was in danger, he would give up everything he hadeverreoeive&
rather than forfeit his liberty: He illum-ates his-position by two storios,—··-

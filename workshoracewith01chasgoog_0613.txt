“ We live in better times .· and we are not afraid to say that,
though then were many clever men in E ngland dur-mg the

latter lealfof the senenteentla centufy, there were only two grefct
cnative mamis. One 0 these mmds produced the Paradae

Lost ,· the other, the Pi grim’s Prog ress.”— ΜΛεΑυιΑΥ.

‘⁸ We believe the Pilgrim’s Prognes to be aa original a work as
ever was written. lt'hms gone through numerous editions, many
os which have appeared m this country: and this Cambridge
edition—which has the merit of coming from the University
Press--is incom bly the best of which we can boast. It has
the advantage oi that coinbination of {nedem typographical lux-
unes and re sor ongmal peculiarities that is now becommg
common, an which in this instance is another proot‘ of Buuyan's

“ Is John Bunyan could have soi-escen that his immor-tal alle·

trials he encoufftered on his. steep and thorny road to ‚heaven
But he was not a man os great worldly sagacity: as he says in
his apology sor his book, —

‘When at first 1 toolt m pen in hand
. Thus sor towrite, 1 di not understand
That 1 at all should make a little Book
In such a mode.’

“The Book is one of the Golden Treasury Series, with a
vignette title and illustrations by Stothard. bound in vellum. and
exquisitely printed. No books are now published which approach
so near to perfection in the art of printing as the books belonging
to this elegant series. ’⁹

THE PRESBYTERIAN. '

‘ A beautiful and tasteful edition os the ‘inimitable dreamer‚’
a book which can never be multiplied too much, or too richly
adomed by the printer*s and engraver’s arts.”

ST. JOHNS GLOBE.
“The ‘Pilgritn’s Progress' is a production which, whilst it
ows mellow with age, never loses its freshneoe. Narly two
undred years have ela d since it was sent forth to the world,
but it is as enerally rea now, and exercises as powerful an influ-
ence‚ as it id when the author first published it. ”

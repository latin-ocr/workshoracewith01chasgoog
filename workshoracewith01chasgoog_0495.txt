meadows were more to be trusted than others, -that is, those which grew in
the shade. Truffles and different kinds of mushrooms were much caten bys
the Romans, as they ure still by the Italians. Of the latter there were und

τελλίνη οι· ξιφὺδρὶον. The ‘ lapathus' is mentioned above as a purgative
(Epod. ii. 57, n.). ‘ Brevis' refers to the size of the plant. . ·

30. Lubrica nascentes implent] That shell-fish were best at the time of the
new moon, appears to have been generally believed among the ancients.

was found, it seems, in great ubundance at Baiae. It would seem not to have
been as useful for the table as for its dyc. The ‘ peloriS‚’ which was found in
the Lacus Lucrinus, close to Baiae, appears to have been an insipid fish,
though Catius says it is better than the murex. The rival oyster-bcds were
in the Lacus Lucrinus and at Circeii, the opposite point of the bay which is
terminated by the promontory os that name, in Latium, and the promontory
of Misenum, in campania. Catius gives the preference to the oysters of
Circeii, which Pliny also says were unsurpassed (xxxii. 21 ). See note on
E . ii. 49. The best oysters‚ however, were found at Brundisium on the
ot er coast, whence the spawn was can-iod to stoek the beds on the coust
of Cam nia and Latium. - -

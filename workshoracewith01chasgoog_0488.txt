186. Ancum &9221me This appears to be nothing but a suitable illustra-
tion invented by Horace. It is obvious enough, and we need not suppose it
a proverb or a current suble of AEsop or any one else.

187. Ne quis bunnam velit] This scene is taken from the remonstranee of
Ulysses with Agamemnon, in the Ajux of Sophocles (v. 1828, sqq.), aster
Ajax has destroyed himself. ‘ Veto, usually governs the infinitive mood.
Once more, as here, Horace uses it with ‘ ne ' and the subjunctive (Epp. ii. 1.
239), and once with the subJunctive, but without ‘ne’ (C. iii. 2. 26). Tibul· ,
lus has ‘veto' with ‘ut': “Illius ut verbis sis mihi lenta veto '’ (ii. 6. 36).
‘Atrida' is the later form of the vocative. The Greek ‘Atride ’ is used iu
Epp. i. 7. 43. ‘ Cur.' is awkwardly placed, as it is in S. 7. 104. The con·
nection with what precedes lies iu the extravagant and imperious conduct of
the king, as illustrating the excesscs of pride, and proving that madan-ss is
found in high places and in the heart of kingS. StertiniuS, it must be re-
membered‚ is exposing the folly of ambition. The dialoguc is supposed to
be between Agamemnon and one of his soldierS, in view of the unburied
corpse of Ajax. ‘ I am a king,' (⁴ 1 am one of the common sort, and dare
ask no more ! ' interposes the soldier humbly‚) — ‘ and moreover the thing is
just that 1 command? There is a good deal of irony here. The justice of
the command is secondary to the will of the despot, and his subject is ready, ·
with instinctive awe, to admit that it is so3 but the tyrant condescends to

Stephens quotes u Greek proverb, μωρῷ καὶ βασιλεῖ νόμος ἄγραφος, ‘Foolg
and kings are governed by an unwrittcn law! Compare Juvenal, ‘⁴ Sic volo
sic jube03 stat ro mtione voluntas ’³ (vi. 223).
191. Da· tibi· (lent capta classem deducere ija .'] This is a version of the
words of Chryses to the king (11. i. 18) :
ὑμῖν μὲν θεοὶ δοῖεν Ὀλύμπια δώματ’ ἔχοντες
ἐκπέρσαι Πριάμοιο πόλιν. εὖ δ’ οἴκαδ’ ἱκέσθαι.
‘ Consulare' is used humorously‚ as if the person mldressed was a jux-iscom-
sultus. On ‘responderess see C. S. 55, n. ·
⁴ 194. Patami} The two forms ‘putrescere’ and ‘patescere » m in uso,
but there is no differeuce of meaning in them. ‘Putrescat' is used above

197. mlle ovium] ‘⁴ ⁴ Mille ¹ in the singular is commonly an adjective 3 in
the plural, perhaps always a substantive.'' An exception to the latter part*
of this rule occurs above (S. i. 6. 111). ‘ Morti dedit ' is exaetly equivalent
to our ‘ put to death! ‘ Do ’ means ‘ to put'3 so its compounds ‘abdm’ ‘to
put away’3 ‘addo,' ‘to put to'3 ‘eond0,' ‘to put togethcr’3 ‘dedo‚’ ‘to
put down ' (one's arms); ‘dido‚’ ‘to put-asundcr or distribute'3 ‘edo‚’ ‘to‘
put forth ’ 3 ‘ indo,' ‘ ὦ put on '; ‘trad0,' ‘to put aeros-S, to hand over,' etc. ³

·δοκῶν ἐν ὑμῖν εἴ α χραίνεσθαι φόνῳ.

199. &dcem Aulide natam} p igenia, the daughter of Agamemnon, was
brought to the altar to be sacrifieed to Artemis, when the Greek flect was²
detained in the port of Aulis, in Euboea‚ on its way to Troy. But the god-·
dess carried her off to be her priestess in Tauri.

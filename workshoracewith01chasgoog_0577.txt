21. ne mea suevus dun-ydros] ‘Mea' belongs to ‘epistola.' ‘Jurgo ' is in·
transitive. ‘ Do not be cruel, and complain because 1 sent 'ou no letter iu
reply.' Florus had written, probably, more than once, expost ting with him
on his silence, and had got no answer.

25. non mittam carmina] ‘ Carmina' means lyric verses, which Florus
seems to have asked for.

26. Luculli miles collecta viatica] As to Lucullus, see Epp. i. 6. 40, n.
Whatever groundwork of truth there may be in this stor ‚ Horace has evi-
dently altered it to suit his purpose. ‘ Viatica ’ would inc ude money as well
as baggage. Cicero uses the word metaphorically for money (Cat. Maj. c.
1›8): “Avaritia senilis quid sibi velit non intelligo. Potest enim quidpiam
esse absurdius quam quo minus viae restat eo plus viatici uaerere ’.ἱ ”

equal to about 852172. of English money, twenty of which (1661. 13⁸. 401.)

from his exploitS, to have held some command. ⁰

ship, and therefore with the title of ‘proconsul.’ A ‘ raetor’ taking a

( 40. qui zonam) perdidit‚] The Romans wore a git-dle when walking or
actively occupied, to hold up the end of their tunic. Hence the expressions
‘praecinctus,' ‘succinctuS,' for those who were hastening or engaged iu
active work. (See S. i. 5. 6, n.) In this girdle (‘zona' or ‘cingulum')
they often carried their money. Hence ‘zona ' came to be used generally
for a purse. The more common word ‘crumena' yvas a bag, generally of
ieamer, hung on the arm or round -the neck, or sometimes perhaps to the

zona! ·

43. Adjecere bonae] The knowledge acquived at Athens was not only
philosophy in all its branches, but Greek literature, withwhich Horace be-
came familiar, especially with the lyric poete, whose works were probably
never taught in the schools at Rome. But he here only refers to his dialecti-
cal studies, which he pursued in the school of the Academy, the 'bad of
which at this time was TheomnestnS‚ whose lectures Brutus attended (Plut.
Brut. c. 24). Acadcmus was an Attic hero, and there was a spot of ground.
-about three quarters of a mile from the cityfon the banks of the Cephisus,
which was dedicated to him and lanted with olives, and called after lus
name, Academia. Here⁷l2lato tang t, and hence his schoolons, named.

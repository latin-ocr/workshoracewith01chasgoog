finger was called ‘ famosus? This name is given to it as the finger of scorn.

The third finger was called ‘ medicus ’ or ⁸ medicinalis,’ for the same reason
probably that got it the name ‘annulari5,’ its supposed anatomical connec-

Maeeenas and his party.

29.- Ut vd oente'nuo paetum The nature and importance of the duties of
Nomentanus were shown on that occasion, when he handed Fundanius. a
daint he had never tasted before, or perhaps heard of, and yet these gentle-
meu 'new what good living was. ' ,

lpas-seres] ‘ Passer’ was a flat fish, and is generally supposed to' be the
auce. . ·
p 31. melimela] These were a sweet sort of rosy apple. The derivation of
the name sufficicntly marks their ssavor. That they had a higher color when
gathered at the wane of the moon, is an invention of the nomenclator. His

’ reasoniug on the subject was so abstruse, that Fundanius does not pretend to

be able to recollect it.
34. Nos nisi damnose bibimus] ,Sec Terence (Heaut. v. 4. 9) :—

· ‘⁴ Ch. At ego si me metuis mores cave csse in te istos sentiam.

Gt. Quoi& Gk. {i scire vis ego dicam ε germ, iners, frauS, helluo, Ganeo,

amnosus.

Vibidius meanS, that if this stupid dinner is to be the death of them,¹ they had
better have their revenge bcl'orchand, and drink ruinously of the host's wine ε
if they do not, they will die unavenged, ‘ Moriemur inulti ' is borrowed from
the Epic style. See Aen. ii. 6703 iv. 659.

35. Vertere pallor Tam parochi faciem] Fundanius gives two reasons why
the host tumed pale when he heard his guests call for larger cnps: because
when men have drank well they give a loose rein to their tongueS, and because
wine spoils the palate'by destroying the delicaey of its taste. He might prob-
ably have added a third, for it seems that in the midst of his ostentation the
man was a niggard. , As to ‘ parochi,’ see S. i. 5. 46. .The host is so called
as the man ‘⁴ qui praebet aquam '’ (S. i. 4. 88). '

' 39. [avenant Aleg‘fam's maaria tota] Allifae was a town of Samnium.
From the text we are led to suppose that cups were made there. ‘ Vinaria’
is properly an adjective. and agrees with ⁶ vasa ' understood. It means hcre
the ‘lagena' or ‘amphoras which differed in shape, but not in use. Both
were vessels either of clay, or sometimes latterly of glass, in which the wine
was ke t. Their conteras were usually poured into a ‘crater' for the pur-
pose otP being mixed with water. These persons helped themselves from· the

l
· tion with the heart. By ‘cetera turba’ Fundanius means the uninitiated, Ἱ

’ ‘ lagena,’ and all followed their example, except the master and his two par-

asites (see above, v. 90). There was no ‘ magister bibendi,’ and the guests
drank as they pleased. ”

· 42. squillas inter muraena natantes] As to ‘squillas‚' see S. ii. 4. 58. ‘Mu-X ’
raena' was a lamprey, and accounted a great delicacy by the Romans, who 5

- appear to have sometimes kept them tame. They were brought chiefly from

the coast of Sicily. The prawns were swimming in sauce, the composition*
of which the host goeson to describe himself, as a matter of too much conse-
quence to be left to the explanation of his nomenclator. The materials were
Venafrian olive-cil (C. ii. 6. 16. n. ; ‘garum,' a sauce made of the entrails
and blood of fieb, and here made from the seomber, perhaps the mat-kerel,
caught in greatest abundant-e off the coast of Spain ; some Italian wine
add-:d while it was making, and some Chian when it was. made; white pep-
per (see above, 4. 74, n.)‚ u'nd vinegar made from sour Lesbiun wine (C. i. 17.

’ἄρδω-τος ἀνδρῶν. Damasippus says hc used, before he lost all his money, to
employ himself in purchasing and reselling ull kinds of valuable property;
among the rest, vessels of Corinthiun bronze (often, but improperly, called
brass), of such antiquit-y that Sisypliu8‚ the founder of Corinth, might be sup-
posed to have used them for washing his feet.. -The rage sor antiquated'
pieees of farnitum went on increasing, and appears to have gone to absurd
lengths during the empire. ' ·

· cephissus b Eurip. (Ion, 1261). The only'other Italian river that was rep'-

resented un er this form was the Eridanus, of which Virgil says (Georg. iv.
371, s . :—
qq) ‘⁴ Et gemina auratus taur-inq cornua vultu
Eridanus, quo non alius per pinguia culta
. In mare purpureum violentior effluit amnis.''
He was therefore represented not only with horas, but with gilded horns.
Horace has probably invented this description of his native river, by way of
magnifying its im rtanee, and ranking it with·the greater streamS. Whence
this conception o a bun, as representing the form of a river-god, may have
arisen, it is not easy to say, but probably from the branching of so many
large streams at their mouths, though that would not apply to the Aufidus.

31. metendo] ‘ And, mowing down first and hindmost‚ strewed the earth, a
scathless vietor.’ Horace (like virgil, Aen. x. 513, ‘⁸ Proxima quaeque

metit gladio”) gets his word from Homer (11. xi. 67), οὶ ὃ ὥστ’ ἀμητῆρες ,

Odes. Before the present Ode was written, the Cantabri had been finally
subdued by Agrippa; the Parthians had restored the standards of Crassus*
and M. Antonius; the Scythians had sent to ask to be taken into alliance;
the distant nations of Asta had done the same (see C. S. 55, sq.) ; the suc·
cesses of Lentulus had checked the inroads of the tribes of the Danube (ii. 9.
23) ; Egypt had long been a tributary ›rovinee3 Armenia (Tigris) had ,been
ceded by the Parthians; Britain, thoug only threatened, had sent tokcns of
submission. Augustus was just returned from Gaul and Spain, where he had
put down the last efforts of rebellion‚ having also driven back the German

tribes (Sigambri), whose success against Lollius had thrown a stain upon the‘

arms of Rome (see C. 2 of this book, Introduction). ἤ

of his stream to do homage to Rome. · ⁴

47. Μίιιοειεε] This word does not occur elsewhere in an classic-al writer.
It redueoe to the form of an adjective ‘ scatentem belluis ' ( . iii. 27. 26). It

Homer’s μεγακὴτης.

Tms Ode appears in early times to have been read as part of the four·

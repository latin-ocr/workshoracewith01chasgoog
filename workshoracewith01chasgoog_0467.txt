NarbonensiS, to distinguish him from Μ. Terentius Varro, who is sometimes
called Reatinus. Different works are attributed to him. His attempts at
satire—in which Horace say3‚ most probably with justice, that he had failed
—are nowhere noticed but here. ·

53. Nil comis traqici mutat Lucilius Acci 9] See below, v. 65. Accius was
born n. e. 170, and was a writer of tragediae, chiefly from the Greek. Cicero
and Quintilian speak very highly of him, and the popular judgment was in
his- favor. See Epp. ii. l. 56, and A. Ρ. 259.
fa 515. nol: ut majore repa-ensis? ⁶ Not as if he were superior to those he finds

u t wit .‘ ’
sp 59. Quid vetat et nosmet] Horace says he is at liberty to inquire whether
it is not a natural consequence of Lucilius's temperament, and the character
of his subjects, that he wrote verses not more polished and smooth than
might be expected of a man who was content with giving his lines the roper
number of feet, and took delight in sti-inging. together a vast number o? them
in the shortest possible time. ‘ Pedibus quid claudere senis ’ explains ⁶ hoe,'
⁶ contented merely with this: that is to say, comprising something (that he
calls a -verse, for there is contempt in ‘quid ') in six feet.

61. Etrusci Quale fuit cassi] of this Cassius we know nothing, and what
Boi-ace says of him is no more than a jocular invention that his writings
were so numerous and worthless that his funeral pile was made of them and
the boxes that contained them.

65. Cbmis et urbanus .‘ Agreeable and refined! ‘ ··-
, 66. Quam rudis et raonis] ‘ Allow that he is more polished than the in·
ventor of a rude style of poetry unknown to the Greeks might be expected to
be, and than the mass of the older poets certainly were 3 still, if he had lived
to this our time, he would have corrected much that he had written) ·

71. vivos 'd roderet unques] ‘ And would bite his nails to the quick‚' as
men sometimes do when they are thinking very nervously.

,⁷2· Saepe stilum vertas] ss‘ Stilurn vertere ' means to erase what had been

written, one end of the iron pen (‘ stilus ’) being broad like the end of a chisel,
for the purpose of obliterating the letters made upon the wax tablet by the
*ahai-p end, which they called ‘ acumen.'
· 7 5. Vilibus in ludas] Such schools as Flavius's, perhaps, if poetry was
ever taught there, or in those-cheap schools in the back streets mentioned in
· Epp. i. 20. 18. The word ‘ dictari ' refers to the practice of the teacher mad-

which are frequently applied to the recitation of the pupil, show that the mod-³
ulation of the voice was a primary consideration in teaching. To help this
most probably was one principal purpose of the master’s reciting to his schol--
ara, which was done quite at the beginning, and probably before the boys·¹
could write3 whence Horace says (Epp. ii. l. 126), “ Os tenerum pueri hab,
bamque poeta figurat.'' It was a good preparation for their subsequent train-
ing under the teacher of rhetoric. It is a raetice which might be more gen·
erally revived, for nothing can be worse t an the way in which boys usually
read or re at their lessons in our schoolS.

7 7. ex Arbuscula] This was a celebrated actress in Cicero's time.
As she, when she was h1ssed off the stage, said she cared nothing for the rest
of the spectatorS, and was satisfied if she pleased the front benches (the
Equites), so Horace says he only wants to be read in the better sort of
schooIS‚ where that class of people sent their sons. .

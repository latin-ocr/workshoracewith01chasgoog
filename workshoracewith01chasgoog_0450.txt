20. Quam Decio noandum novo] P. Decius uS, who devoted himself to
death fon his country at the battle of Vesuvius, in the Latin war, n. c. 340,
was the first consul· os his familv. He held the office with Τ. Manlius Tor-

. quatus in that year. After the curule magistracies were opened to the plebei-

ans, an order of nobili sprung up among tliemselveS, based u n the hold-

censorque moveret Appius] The Appius who is here taken as· the type of
severe censorship is Appius. Claudius CaecuS, the constructor of the road and
aqueduct that bore his name (see S 5. 2). He was made Censor n.c. 312.
It was the province of the Censois, till that office was merged in the imperial
power, to supply vacanci'es in the senate from the list of those who were
eligible, who were all citizens of at least equestrian rank, of not less than a

could also, in revising the list of senators at the beginning of their censorship,
degrade those who had previously been in the senate, as well as exclude such
as by their official rank were entitled to be senators, This they did, at their
own discretiori, for various offences by which ‘ignominia ' was liable to be
incurred, or from the senator having been ‘choscn improperly. They effected

· this exclusion merely bv marking the name, and the-ir mark was called ‘ nota

censoria‚’ and the act itscls, ‘notare' Horace, therefore3 means that if he,
through the favor of Maecenas or other means, sought- as a fmedman’s son to
mach the dignity of a senator, and succeeded, the censors, if they did their
duty strictly, would degrade him. The eensor Appius, however, is notorious
for his laxity in having chosen, for party purposeS, the sons of frcedmen, and
other unqualificd prople, into the senate. But he was harsh and arbitrary in
the exer-eise of his office, and his name was proverbial in connection with the
censorship, which is enough to account for his appearance here. There was
no money qualification for the senate, but onl . one of rank. ‘ Movere ' is the
technical word for degiading a senator, and t ose who were degraded, or not
admitted, were called ‘praeteriti senatores ' from the circumstance of their
being merely passed b when the lists were made out, and their names not
appcaring‚ which woul prevent them from acting.

‘ Let'the populace set their hearts upon rank and dcscent, and let the censors
make that. their standard for the senate, yet the linmbly born may have their
honors as well '3 that is, the honors that arise from virtue and genius. The
picture of Glory mounted on her c'ar is repeated in Epp. ii. 1. 177, where the
epithet ‘ fulgente' is exchanged for ‘ ventoso,' ‘ fickle as the winde?

z· EPISTLns.— BOOK 1. · α 533

'short description of Horace’s residence, in anticipation of the inquiries he
supposes Quintius might make on that subject. ⁹ ’

1. fundus] See S. ii. 5. 108, n.

2. Arvo pascat Iterum] Horace had some of his land under his own culti-
vation ς bnt it was no great quantity, as we may infer from the number of
slaves employed upon it (S. ii. 7. 118). The rest he seems to have let (Epp.
14. 2, 11.). Part of his land was araffle, and part of it meadow (Epp. 15.
26-30, and C. iii. 16. 30, “se etis certa fides meae ”). He had a garden
(Epp. 14. 42). He must also ave· had vines (23, n.). In short, it was an
ordinary farm on a small scale. In the second and third verses Horace re·
coluntgo the different productione of his farm, while he supposes Quintius to
as ’ a ut t em. “ v

2. opulentet] This is a rare word, and does not occur in any earlier writer.

13. cm, amida vitibus ulmo,] See C. ii. 15. 5: “platanusque caelebs Evineet
u mos?

5. Continui monoes] The valley of the Licenza is the only valle which
cuts the range of mountains extending from the Camp a above ibur to
Carseoli, about fort ·tive miles from Rome. Without offis valley this im-

·mense body would a continuous mass. It lies nearly north and south,

which corresponds with the description of the text. See C. i. 17. 1, n.
·8. Temperiem laudea] The position of the valley keeps it cool in summer

· and warm in winter, the latter by the exclusion of tbe north wind (Tramon·

tana). The Seirocco (‘plumbeus Auster’) is modified in its strength and
character as it penetrates the mountainS.

Quid, si rubicunda] ‘Why, if 1 tell you that my thorns bear abundantly
the red cornel and the plum„that my oaks and my ilexes delight my pigs
with plenty of acorns, and their master with plenty of shade‚ you may say it
is the woods of Tarentum, brought nearer to Rome! ‘ Fruge' is nowhere
else used for aeornS, the common food for pigS.

12. Fons etlam] There are two small streams which seed the Licenza in
this valle , which that river nearly biseetS. Either of these rivulets may be
the one orace allu'des to.

14. fletit utili-sd See note on v. 8 of the last Epistle.

15. dulce-3, etiam εἰ credis amoenae,] A place may be ‘dulcis ’ from associ-
ation or other causes: it can only be ‘ amoenus ' from its climate, its beauties,
and so forth. As to ‘ Septembribus hori8,’ see S. ii. 6: 18, n., and for ‘audis '

· see note on v..20 of the same Satire.

· 17. Tu recte vivis] He goes on to compliment and advise his friends

‘Your life is what lt should be, if you are earefnl to be what you are ac-

countcd. For all Rome has long spoken of you as a happy man. But I am·

afraid lest, you should trust the judgment of others about you, rather than
our own.

y 24. pudor malus] See S. ii. 3. 39, n. He says it is a false shame that

would induce a patient to conceal his sores from the ph sician3 and so it is

'for a man to hide his defects, rather tha-n bring them to t e wise to cure.

25. Siquis bella tibi] ‘ Tibi ’ depends on ‘pugnata,' which is joined with

'‘bella' in C. iii. 19. 4. See note on C. ii. 6. 11. Quintius had no doubt
, seen sei-viee3 but, says Horace, if any one were to speak of your campaign-

ing 11¹ such langue-ge as this (then he quotes two lines, said to be taken from
the panegyrie of Varius on Augustus, referred to on C. i. 6. 11 ), you would

recognize it as meant, not fo· you, but for Caesar. But if you allow yourself ο

to be called wise and correct, does your· life correspond to that name any
more than your military exploits to the above encomium? Literall , ‘Do
you answer in your own name,’ or ‘on' your own account? ’ ‘ acuas
aures ' are ears which, beissg unoccnpied‚ are ready to receive what is spoken.

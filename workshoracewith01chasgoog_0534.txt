aerarium, nullum vectigal habet. Nihil illo regno spoliatius, nihil rege egen-
tius ’' (vi. 1). M. Brutus had advanced him lar sums of mone at exorbi-
tant interest, which he was unable to pay, an Cicero, though e got loo
talents from him, was unable to extract all the debt. Cn. Pompeius too was
his creditor, and all he could get was a promissory hond for 200 talenta, pay-
able in six months (vi. 3). Horace advises his man not to let himself be as
poor as this king. ‘ Hic' is an adverb, like ἐνταῦθαε it means ‘in this po-
sition! (See Epp. 15. 42.) , .

40. chlamydes Lucullus, ut aiunt,] L. Licinius Lucullus, being proconsul
in Cilicia, conducted the war against Mithridates and Tigranes, king of Ar-
menia, as related by Plutarch in his life, but being superseded in his eom-
mand by Cn. PompeiuS, he returned to Rome with great wealth accumulated
by himself in Asia, which he devoted to every sort of costly self-indulgence.
Plutarch relates this anecdote of Horace’s, with a little variation. A praetor

who wished to get up a public spectacle on an ambitious scale (φιλοτιμοψ

have them. The next day he asked him how many he wanted, and when
the praetor said a hundred, Lucullus bade him take twice that number.

The ‘ chlam s ' was an u per garment worn by the Greele, a light sort of
shawl thrown oosely over tile person in a variety of ways. The Romans did
not wear it till the time of the empire, and it was never more than an occa·
sional gai-ment at Rome. LuculluS, it seems, had brought with him a large
number of a costly kind from Asia, where they were worn in the Greek cities.
What the representation may have been for which the praetor wanted these
‘ chiam des ’ is not certain, but Greek characters must have been introduced.

50. Blercemur servum] There was a class of slaves called ‘ nomenclatores ’

or ‘fartores' (crammcrs), ὀνοματολόγοι, whose office it was to accompany
their master when walking, or attend him at home at the honr of ‘ salutatio '
(when, if he was a person of consequence, people of all sorts came to pay him
their respects), and to remind him of the names and circumstances of his
visitorS, and anything, else that it might be necessary for the master to re-
member. If he was aiming at any office, he had to be particularly polite to
the citizens of all classes, and his ‘ nomenclator‚' if he were elever, would be
of good service to him in this matter. Horaee's advice to the man who
thinks happiness depends on such things as show and popularity (‘species et
gratia') is, that he should hire a elever ‘ nomenclator,’ if he had not one of
his own, to go with him through the streetS, and nud e him whenever he
came to any one of influence, and remind him to shake iands and sa some-
thing civil to him, calling him affectionately ‘ my brother,' ‘my fat er‚' ac-
cording to his age. ‘ Nomenelatores ' were also employed to explain to the
guests the names and qualities of the dishes, and parasites sometimes took
this office upon themselves, as we have seen in S. ii. 8. .

51. coya! trans pondera dextram PoquereJ ‘ Cogat ' merely expresses the ·’
cnergy of the nomenclator. ‘ Pondera ’ means obstructions of vanous kinds,
which were common in the narrow streets of Rome, as Horace describeS,
Epp. ii. 2. 72, sqq„ and Juvenal (iii. 245). He was to stretch out his hand
to shake hands with the votens. Cicero (Pro Plane.) speaks of P. Scipio
Nasica, when a candidate for the aedileship, shaking hands with some rough
voter, angl ¹’al-sking him good-humoredly “if he walked on his handS,” they
were so a . .

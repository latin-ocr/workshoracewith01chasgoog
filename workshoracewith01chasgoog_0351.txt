ODE XII.

Tms Ode represents a girl lamentin to herself offer Move she must not
indulge. Iler name is Neobule, and t at. of the man, she loves is'· HebruS,
whom she represents as the perfectiora of beauty and manliness. The Ode

appears to have been imitated, if not translated, from one of AlcaeuS, of which
one verse in the same metre is extant.

Anemmn’r. — Poor women! wo must not love, we must not drown care
in wine, or a cruel guardian scolds us to death. Alam, Neobule ! thou canst
not s in nor work, for love of HebruS, so beautiful as he bathes in the waters
of Ti r, a horseman like Belerophon, unsurpassed in the combat and· the
moe, in piercing the fiying deer or catching the lurking boat.

1. Mseramm ese] ‘'It is the fate of unhappy women)

.2. aut] ‘ or, if we do.'

3. Patr-nae] Compare (Sat. ii. 3. 88) “ ne sis patruus mihi? On the form
‘lavem,' see C. ii. 3. 18, n.

4. qualum] ‘ my wool-basket.' The name Neobule is found in a fragment
of Archilochus. Hebrus's birthplaoe is mentioned to give more reahty to
the person. Lipara, it must be admitted, was an odd place to choose. It
was one of the vulcaniae Insulae, and is still called Lipari. .

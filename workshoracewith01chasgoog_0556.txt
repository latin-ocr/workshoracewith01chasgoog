Cicero did not approve of it. He sayS, “vetat Pythagoras injussu imperato-
ris, id est Dei, de praesidio et statione vitae decedere ’' (Cat. Maj. e. 20).
The ancients had very loose notions on suicide.

EP1·STLE xv11.

Wno Scaeva was there· are no means of determining, and it is quite isn-
matcrial. He bears no art in the Epistle, which might have been addressed
to anybody of his age. pm professed purpose is to instruct a youn’g man how
to rise in the world by paying court to great people, which rs declared to be
an art of no small merit. The chief secret of this 'art is said to be a weli-
affected modesty, and a tact in letting your wants be rather felt than heard by

your patron, and this is the only advice that is offered. The Epistle ends
abrupssy, and 1s a mere fragment. -

3. docendus adhuc-‚J He was young, and had yet much to leam. ‘Amicu-
lus ’ is a diminutive expressing cndearment.

4. Caecus iter monstrare velit ;} Erasmus quotes as a proverb μήτε τυφλὸν
ὁδηγὸν, μήτε ἐκνᾶητον σύμβουλον. Our Lord twice used it 1'11 instrueting
his disciples (Mart. xv. 14, Luke vi. 39).

8. Ferentinum] This was a municipium on the Via Latina, about sorty-
six miles from Rome, in the country of the Hernici. It still retains its name
Ferentino. It appears not to have been much frequented, and Horace necom-
mends his friend to go there, if the ohiect of his wishes is to avoid the noise

of thg ttown, and to lead a quiet life, which he says is not without its reeom-
men a ione.

-. 10. moraebnsquefl’fillit] Horace uses ‘saliere ' as the Greeks used λανθάνειν.

(see C. iii. 16. 32, ιι). But it is only used absolutely here and in the next
Epistle (v. 103). Horace takes his expression from the Greek proverb
λάθε βρώσεις, which appears to have been used by the Epicureans· and
'CXII-lepaggssrodesse tuis] Horace's argument for servility is, that it is neces-
sary, if aman wants to be of use to his friendS, and to make himself com-
ἲοῗὲῳξῖοεαε ad unctum] As a poor man to the rich. ‘ Siccus ³ means poor,
as one who cannot command a dinner, or can only command a dry one;
and ‘ unctus ’ means a rich man who fares sumptuously. The Cynics were

called ξηρόφαγοι from their absdnenoe, and ξηροφαγία among the early
Christians was a fast.

13. Si pranderet olus patienter] There is a story of Aristippus, that he was
one day passing Diogenes, the Cyme, while he was washing some vegetablcs
for his dinner‚ and he was accosted thus : Α “ If you had learnt to put up with
this, you would not have been a slave in the palace 'of kings,’‘ alluding *to

his having been the guest of Dionysius of Syracuse. The answer of Aris· ·

tippus was: “And if you knew how to associate with your fellow3, you
would not now be washing herbS.”
15. qui me notat] ‘Notare’ is used in a bad sense (see S. i. 6. 20, n.).
18. Illorgiacem Cynicum] The Cynics received their-name frorlrli the pssfie

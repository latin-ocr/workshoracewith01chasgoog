2ο. Empedocles an Stetrtimuml· Empedocles was bom about Β. c. 520, and
was a man of weatth and station at Agrigentum in Sicily. He was a phi-
losopha, but his opinions are ba‘rd to traco. He pretended to a divine nature.
(See A. P. 463, sqq.) His poems, of which fingments are extant, were much
read and admired by the Romans. Horace refers perhaps ω’ a dogma im-
puted to Empedoclem, to which Cicero allodes (De Amic vii.) when he says
“Agrigentinum quidem doctum quendam virum carminibus Graecis vatici-
natum ferunt, quae ἰιι nerum natura totoque mundo constan-ent quaeque gno-
vetentur, ea conuehere amicitiam, dissipare discordiam?

different authors, chronologically arranged. ln this way a. complete course
of reading in this department can be pursued in one book, aud the trouble
of changing from the works of one author to those of another ln a great
degree obviated. The name of the late President Felton gives a sufficient
guaranty of the excellence of the selectim, and it js enough to say that
the plan has been in every respect universally approved. To show the

· EPODE IV(

. Am„ -the positive information we can dei-ive from this Ode in respect to its
purport and date is, that it contains a· vehement invective against some per-
·son of low birth and contem tible character, who gave himself airs and dis·
gusted the people of Rome; e was also a military tribune.

· mennas-r. - Ι hate thee, -thouwhipped slave, as ‚the lamb hates the wolf
and the wolf the lamb. Be thou never so proud, luck <loth not change the
¹breed. See, as thou swaggerest down the ron-d, how they tumand say, “ Here
is a sooundrel who was floggedtill‘ the crier was tired, and now he has his

aeres, and ambles on his nag, and sits among the EquiteS, and snaps his ·

fingere, at Otho and his law. What is the use-of our· sending ships to attaek
'the pirateS, 11 such a rascal as this is to be military tribune 21? ,

{hoio} apelideng fate, or nature (as here) ha's assigned. See notes on C. i. 9.

3. Hibericis —fum‘busl These were eords made of ‘ spartum,' usually said
to be the Spanish broom. It was· made into ropeS, especially for ships' rig-
fging. In the army they flogged with vine twigs.

7. metiente] ‘As thou measurest the Sacred Way! ‘ Metiri¹ is used by
the poets in expressing motion of various kinds, with ‘ viam‚' ‘ iter,’ ‘ mare,'
etc. Here it shows the man's strut and swagger. The Via Sacra was
crowded with public buildings,¹ and was a favorite lounge. See S. i. 9, 1.

8. bis trium ulnarum toya‚]- The Romans of this period used ‘ ulna’ as an
equivalent for ‘ cubitus ’; therefore ‘ bis trium ulnarum ' must be understood
,to have reference to the width of the toga, not the length, which was much
greater, about three times the height of the wearer from the shoulder to the
ground. The effect. of so wide a toga would be to give a broad imposing
appearance to the mau’s person. Compare S. ii. 3. 183: “ Latus ut in circo
s nere. '

pg. vertat] This means that the passengers turned to one another, and also
-tumed to look at the eoxcomb and point at him. v

sumas. -— BOOK 11. ἶ’479

’‘Ulysses' of all poets after Homer is a contemptible personage, and it 'must be
said in favor of Horace that Penelope, whose character ’in the Odyssey i's
feminine and pure, is by later writers represented as less chaste than Homer
has drawn heri 'l'hose who only know he‘r as the virtuous wife fiand mother,
will not easily forgive the coarse allusione to her in this Satire. ’

3. Quid n‘des 5] These words 'are spoken hy Ulyssem Teiresias may ‘be
supposed to smile at Ulysses for asking advice in a matter' in which his own
cral'tiness would help him better than any counsel he could receive. The
prophet’s answer meanS, that, when he gets back to his home, his wits.will
soon teaeh him how to -repair his-fortune. ‘Jamne ’ means, ‘what‚ now 1
have told youthat you will get home ’ἒ '

6. te vata} See Hom. Od ss, xi. 110. The dialogus is ⁴supposedto be a
'continuation of that which omer relates, and takes place in. HadeS. See
Introduction.

7. apotheca] See C. iii. 8. ll, n. -

9. missis ambaqibusfl The ‘ambages ³ were Ulysses’ fine words about

,birth and merit, and Teiresias perhaps means, ⁶ Since you will have m'y ad-
vice, let us waste no wordS, but begin! ²

. , 10. Turdus] This bird, the fieldfare, if well fattened, was considered {a
great delicacy by the Romans. ·In Epp. i. 15. 40, the glutton‘ Maenius pro·
,nounces- that there is nothing better than one of these birds, “obeso nil me·
‚lius turdo ’:; and the host at Beneventum produced a dish of them in honor
'of his visitorS, but the were poor thin S, and he did not know how to dres's

,them (S. i. 5. 72). lie fieldfare is stil reckoned a delicate bird. ‘Privunr' ¹

means for your own private eating.
a· 14. Ante Larem] The first-fruits were offered to the Lares. See Tibull.
1. 1· 13 ⁶ “ Et quodcunque mihi pomum novus educat annus · ·
. Libatum agricolae ponitur ante dco.'' , ” ‚
No divinity⁸ was „dearer to a Roman than his LareS, whose images stood i‘n
{his hall, who reminded him of his departed ancestorS‚ and whom he invoked
and sacrificed tossevery day at his meals (see C. iv. 5. 34).

15. sine yentat] Suppose him to be a ‘libertinu8,' and in former days to
have run away rom his master, in which ease he would be brandcd on thje
forehead, and the shame of attending him would be greater. He would also
'be ‘ sine gente,’ that is, he would belong to no ‘ gens‚' if he were a freedman
,or the descendant,of a freedman. ι , , “

17. Tu comes exterior] Teiresias advises that, if the rich man should call
{¹333} ἱῖἐῖὲέἑῗ 13¹3,ssssss 2523? &3255 322033’133 {22:¹332523'32532‘25‘31232‘5&
between him and the mad. The expressions ⁴ tegere latnS,' ‘ claudere latus,’
were common, ‘and' meant to take that side which was most exposed.

18. Utne teyam] This is a short way of saying ‘ hortarisne me ut tegam ’.ἱ '
‘Damae' is used generally as a common name of slaves (see S. i. 6. 38).
‘ Spurcus? is a word Lucilius used, as in that ve‘rse quoted by Cicero (Tuse.
ii. 17) 4 “Ergo hoc poterit ‘ Samnis spurcus homo vita illa dignus locoque ’ἐ ' ''

20. hoc] When Teircsias tells him he must be conte-nt to be poor, or do
as he bids him, Ulysses consents to the degradation rat-her than incur the pov-
erty, and makes a merit of doing so: he will bear the disgrace with his usual
magnanimity. The hero's language is a parody of that which Homer puts
into his mouth (odyss, xx, 18) : '

And τέτλαθι δὴ, κραδίη· καὶ κύντερον ἄλλο ποτ’ ἔτλης. ,
v. 223 : ·
ἤδη γὰρ μάλα πόλλ’ ἔπαθον καὶ πόλλ’ ἐμόγησα
Κύμασι καῖπολέμῳ· μετὰ ica} τόδε τοῖσι γενέσθώ. ’

They also sent ambassadors to Rome, and demanded, as a condition oftheit‘·
assistance, that one of the consuls should always .be *a Campanian. Five
years afterwards the Romans took the town, and dealt -very severely with it,
reducing it to a >praefectum (see S. i. 5. 34, n.). As to Spartacus‚see Ὁ. iii.
6. Ambrae-,l The Allobroges, whose country la on the lest bank ef· the
Rhene, between that -river and the- lsere, had am sadors at Rome at the
time of Catiline’s conspiracy, praying for redress for certain grievanceS.
- These men were tampered with hythe conspiratorS, and promised to forward
their designsjwhich, soon repenting, they betrayed, and became the principal
witnesses against the conspirators (Sall. Cat. 41; Cic. in Catil. iii. 2-4).
This explains Horace's meaning. Two ‘years afterwards these people, hav-
ing broken but in war and invaded Gallia NarbonensiS, were defeated by C.
{omptirssiffiGgovernor of that province. 'Their restlessness is mentioned by
.aesar . .iv.5. ’
8. Pizrentibus] 2I'h-is is like “ bella matribus detestata’' (C. i. 1. 24).
“ 11. insistet] ⁸ Insistere ' is followed by the accusative case sometimeS, par-
ticularly when it, implies motion, as ‘insistere viam,' which peculiarity is
found in the Greek καθέζομαι. It more usually governs the dative case, or
is followed by the ablative after ‘ in.’ See Aen. vi. 563: ‘⁴ Sceleratum insis-
tere limen.'' Ezekiel's prophecy against Tyre- declares that Nebuchadnezzar
“with the hoofs of his horses shall tread down all her streete '’ (xxvi. ll)3
and Jeremiah exclaims (viii. 1, 2): “At that time they shall bring out the
bones of th'e kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of

. the priests, and the bones of the prophete, and the bones of the inhabitants of

Jerusalem out of their graves, and they shall spread them before the sun. z
they shall not be gathered nor be buried3 they shall be as dung on the face
of the earth.'' Horace does not take account of the apotheosis of Romulus«,
which he himself refers to elsewhere ⁶(C. iii. 3. 16). Porphyrion, on the
authorityof Varro, says the tomb of Romulus was behind the Rostra.

15. eapede’at] This belongs to ‘ carere '3 ‘what course befits us best, that
,we be free from our· vile sufferings,' where the Greeks would express or (more
commonly) understand ὥστε. The story os· the Phocaeans abandoning their
city when Harpagus was besieging it, and declaring that the would not
return till a bar of iron they threw into the sea should float, is told by Heroas
otus (i. 165). It must have been familiar to educated men, and the femor
oath may have become proverbial. ‘ Exsecrata’ is used in a middle sense,
ἕ binding· themselves under a curse‚' ἐπωῆσαντο ἶσχυρὰς κατάρας. So
‘agros ’ is governed by ‘ profugit‚’ not by ‘ exsecrata? -

23. Sic placet ?] ‘ lacetue ‘3 ' the usual formula addressed to the people at
the comitia. The poet fancies himself addressing a meeting of *the citizens,
‘ Habet suadere ’ is another Greek construction, πείθειν ἔ ει.

. 25. Sed juremus in haec .·] ⁴ but let us take an oath in s form’3 to make
our departure inevitable. ' .

{al raam] C. iii. 27. 3, n. ‘Levis hircus amet‚’ ‘the goat become sleek,
an ove.

41. Oceanus] The Atlantic.

42. divites et insulas, See C. iv. 8. 25, n.

46. 'Suamque pulla cus ornat arborem‚] ‘and the purple fig adorus its. own v

trec '3 that is, without grafting. .
ι)-ῃῗὶἒι.’,τὶαειερειέἰηιεει] See C. i. 2. 45. Virg. Georg. iii. 538 ε “ Nocturnus oham}⁴

ODE XIII.

Tms Ode has been noticed in the introduction to C. iii. 10. It is not un-
like the fifteenth of the same book. It is professedly addressed to an old·
woman, Lyce, who is t ing to keep upcher charms. The poet writes as if
the s had answened is prayers by taking away her beauty for the cruelty
she {22¹1 shown· him. It is most probably an imitation.

Anconem. — My prayers are answeoed, Lyce. Thou art old, and would .
captivate δύης but love abides only on the fresh cheek, and runs awayL

‘ cruoribus ’ is unusual, and savors of the Greek. So Aesch. Supp. 265.-

6. Periculosae pienum opus aleae] ‘ A task full of hazard,’ literally, ‘full
of perilous chance! Pollio had been faithful to Julius Caesar, but after his
death had sided rather with M. Antonius than Augustus; and therefore,
when the latter had succeeded in puttin an end to his rival, and had the
entire power in his own handS, it was a ld and difficult task that Pollio

, had undertaken. It does not appear, however, that he involved himself in

any difficulty with Augustus, for he lived quietly to a good old age, dying in

jealouS, and could afford to be otherwise. See Tae. Ann. iv. 34. ‘ Aleae ’
was the name for dice (see C. iii. 24. 58) 3 here it means ‘ hazard,' ‘ risk?

ibpg giress likgelthe ashes at the mouth of a volcano, 0001 on the sursace,

10. mox ubi publicas Res ordinaris] ‘ When you shall have finished »your “ ’

history of public events! The Greeks used συντάσσειν for writing a book.

Plutarch uses σῦντᾳγμα for a book. Ἀνατάξασθαι occurs in the prefaee to
St. Luke's Gospel, and is thus rendered in the Vulgate translation, ‘⁴ Quo-
niam quidem multi conati sunt ordinare narrationem? It seems that Pollio

theme is delicate, and he is well.able to adom it, he should ut aside the only

ll. orande munus] ‘ εἦπου shalt put on the Attio cothurnuS, and return to
thy lofty task! The ‘ cothurnus ' was a shoe worn by tragic actors, the use
and name 'of which were horrowed by the Romans from the AthenianS. It
was usually ornamented with purple, and strapped up the leg nearly to the
knce. When worn on the stage, it had a thick sole and a high heel, to add to
the actor's height. Men of rank wore the ‘ cothurnus? Horace speaks figu-
ratively, when he says that Pollio shall put on the ‘ cothurnus: meaning that
he shall return to writing tragedies (see last note).

21. Audire—videor] ‘I seem to myself to hear’ (as C. iii. 4. 6), refer-
ring to what he had heard Pollio read (see Int.). Cicero uses ‘ videor ’ with
‘ videre ' not unfrequently, as (De Am. 12), ‘⁴ videre jam videor populum a
senatu disjunctum.”

23. cuncta terrarum subacta] It is probable that Pollio had given a stin-ing
account of Caesar's African campaign, in which he himself served, and that
his description had made a great impression upon Horace. The victory of
Thapsus, B. c. 46, made Caesar master of the whole Roman world. ‘ Cuncta
terrarum ' is equivalent to ‘ cunctas terras.’

24. atrocem] ‘stubborm’

25. Juno et dem-um] ‘Juno and all the gods that favor Africa, who 'had
departed helplessly (i. e. after the «Iugurthino war) and left that land un-
avcngcd, have offered u as an atonement (‘ mttulit ’) the grandsons of those
victors‚· on the grave of ugurtha? ‘ Inferiae ' or ‘ parentalia’ were offerings
presented by relatives at the tombs of the dead. Ten thousand of the Pom-
peian army alone fell at the battle of Thapsus. It has been suggested that

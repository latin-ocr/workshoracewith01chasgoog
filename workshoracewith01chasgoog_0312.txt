Epp. i. 12. 26). They were one of the fiereest of the tribes of Hispania, a‘nd
the last that submitted to the Romans. They occupied a part of the north

5. Tibur] Tibur (Tivoli), which was sixteen miles east of Rome, Horace
was in the habit of visiting (see C. iii. 4. 23. Ep . i. 7. 45). He here ex-
prelsses a 1‹lglreat affeaetxition fproiu smbgblzuppose he ad a house there, which,

Aryeo -colonoJ catinus, or is brother Tiburtus (see C. i. 18. 2, in).

7. Sic modus lasso] ‘Lasso ' may be taken with ‘ maris} etc. (as ‘fessi re—
rum,' Aen. i. 178), or absolutely, leaving the genitives to depend on ‘ modus ' ε
or the genitives may depend upon both. Itis probable Horace is only speak-
ing generally, meaning that the weary need seek no happier testing-place than
Tibur, or Tarentum. .

10. pellitis] This word -refers to the practice of covering the ’sheep with
skiuS‚ to preserve their wool. The Galaesus (Galaso) flowed through the
ager Tarentinus, which was rich in gai-dens and corn-land, as well as in pas-
. tures. .

11. regnata] Simila: passivas are found in C. iii. 3. 43, “ Medis triumpha-

5. 27, “ Res certabitur) ‘Regnata' occurs again in C. iii. 29 27 ; and Ta-
citus (Hist. i. 16) speaks of “ gentes quae regnantur.” The word is not used
by prose-writers of an earlier age than Tacitus. Phalanthus of Lacedaeinon
headed a body of youths, called from the circumstances of their birth Parthe-

o aren um. -

15. decedunt] This word is used again in the same ‘sense of ‘ giving place
to ' in the second epistle of the second book, v. 213 : “ decede peritis.’' The
honey of Tarentum or Calabria (iii. 16. 33), and of Matinum (iv. 2. 27) in
Italy, of Hybla in Sicily, and of Hymettus in Attica, are those Horace cele·
brates most. Venafrum (hod. Venafro) the most northern town of Campa-
nia was celebrated above all places in Italy forits olives. ‘ Venafro ’ iz the
dative case. See C. i. 1. 15, 11. - ·

18. Aulon] From the name, we may suppose this was a valley near
Tarentum. {t gave excellent pasturage to sheep. ‘ Baccho ' depends on
‘ amicus! .

21. beatae —arces ,·] Rich heights or hills near Tarentum. ‘Arx ' is akin ο
to ἕρκος, and signifies primm-ily a fortified place ; and fortified places being.-
eoiililmonly on heights, ‘arx,’ in a derived sense, came to mean a hill gen-
era .

usually bui-iod, though buming was known even in old times.

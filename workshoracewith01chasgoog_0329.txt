ODE XIX.

'rme Ode was perhaps composed at the time of the Liberalia, like the
third elegy of the fifth book of O‘vid’s Tristia. The scene is laid in the
voods, and the poetis supposed to come suddenly u on the party, consisting
of BacchuS, with his attendant nymphs aud the wil creamres of the woodS,
all attending with admiration to the god as he sings his own aehievements.
The poet is emitten with terror, which gives place (v. 9) to the inspiration
of the divinity, in virtue of which he breaks out into echoes of all he had

Cerberus did erouch to thee, and lick thy feet.

1. Bacchum] The legenda and attributes of Bacchus contained in' this Ode
are entirely of Greek origin. The Romans had no independent notions of

this divinity, whose name Βάκχος, ‘ the shouter,’ is properly no more than an
adjunct of Διόνυσος.

2. docentem - de‘seentes These correspond to the terme διδάσκειν and
μανθάνειν, as applied to e choragus who trained, and the chorus who leams:
their, parts in the Greek pla s. “

3. Nymphasque} The hyr-indes and Dryades (see C. iii. 25. 14). These
nymphs were the nurses of Bacchus in his mfancy, and are always represented
as his com anions.

4. capr-gadum Satyrorum] The Sat ‘ are usually confounded with the
Fauns, Faunus again being confounde( with Pan, who was represented with
goat's feet like the Satyrs. Lueian describes the Satyrs as being ὀξεῖς ἰ-ἰιο
ὦτα, but only describes Pan as having the lower extremities like a goat, τὰ
κάτω αἰγὶ ἐοικώς, Itis vain, therefore, trying to nane any consinoeney iu the
poet’s conceptions of these uncouth divinitieS.

6, 7. turbidum Laetatur] ‘beats wildly!

9. Fas est]⁴ ‘the god permits me.' Here the [ἕξει is supposed to recover
from the terror inspired by the god, and to feel t he is at liberty to repeat
what he has heard. ‘ Fas est ’ is equivalent to δυνατόν ἐστι. T-he power as
well as the· ermission of the god is given. C. i. ll. l, n.

Thyiadas The attendants of Bacchus were so called, from the Greek word
θῦειν, ‘to rave.' ’

10. lactis-mella ς] The same attribute that made Dionysus the god of
wine also ve him milk and honey as his types. He re resented the exu-
berance 0 nature, and was therein closely connected wit Demeter. Any
traveller in the Επεὶ can tell of honeycombs on the trees as curiously wrought
as any in gau-‹len-hives. virgil says (Ec. iv. 3o): “Et durae quercus suda-

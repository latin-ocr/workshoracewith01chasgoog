com ared with the best, to which Maecenas was used, and this probably had
not ad the benefitof keeping. Horace commende it, themsore, by referring
to the circumstances under which it was bottled (as we should say).—The
most ordinary kind of earthen-warc jug was called ⁶ cantharus: supposed

‘ Caecubum ' was the fincst sort of wine in Horace’s time. It was grown in
the ‘ Caecubus ager,' in Latium, at the head of the bay of Amyclas. The
Calenian was from Cales (now Calvi) in Campania. Close by Cales was ¹

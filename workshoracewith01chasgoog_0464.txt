that there was nothing ille al in the conduct of the plaintiff in such a ease aa,

the above, and that the d cudant had resisted, and that force was necessary.

’ The process was by touching the ear of the person whose testimony was1

asked, who could not be compelled to be a witness 3 but after he had consented,
he was bound to appear ‘and give evidence if required. Horace was only too

glad to help in the forcible removal of his persecutor, and gave his car with,
all readiness. The parties begin to wrangle: a crowd, of idlers of course>-

forntils round them, and Horace makes his escape. By ‘ vero ’ he means ‘iu
goz-ezrslffitkn jun 5] ‘ Iu jus vocare ' ,is a technical expression having refer-
ence to the first step in a civil action when both parties appeared before the
praetor or other magistratus having ‘jurisdictio‚’ with the view of fixing a day
for the commeneement of the trial. On this occasion the ‘vadimonium’

above described was entered into. ‘In jus vocares therefore, being the first‘

step, could not follow upon the neglect of the ‘vadimonium' by Horace's

companion; and the ‘ adversarius ' in this case cannot be the plaintiff iu the,

other (v. 36), unless Horace is speaking loosely.

 

SATIRE X.

Tun line of self-defence Horace took in the fourth Satire (see Introduction:⁸

and v. 6, n.) led him into a criticism of Lucilius, which gave a ,fresh handle·
to his adversaries, who professed an admiration for that poet, but admired²
him for h'is worst faults of taste, and especially for his combination of Greek
words with his mother tongne,-a practice the affectation of which no one,
would more instinctivcly feel and condemn than Horace. Horace adher-es
to his criticism, and says, if Lucilius had lived, he would have been the first to,
find faults in his own style, and to correct it. ’

guggeE‘lkffiaeraeplielff‘aegffstloeffiaell‘m‘ins was the most distinguished writer of this·
particular kind of play that we know of. He died the Ὗ year before the battle
of Philippi, Α. u. c. 711, and, therefore before this Satire was written. The·
Roman mimes were, in the time of Laberium represented in the theatres with
the regular drama. They were a combination of grotesque ‹lumb-show, of
dances by men and women, of fareical representations in verse-dialogue, of
incidente in low ami rofligate life, and of grave sentimenrs and satirical al-
lusions inters ersed with the dialogue. Augustus was a great patron of these?

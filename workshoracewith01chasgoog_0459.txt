,ναι-δίει Hence σῦκινοε ἄνδρες meant men firfor nothing( Priapus was ἡ
mral divinity‚ borrowed by the Romans from the lauet mythology of the
Greeks. He was the protector of fiockS, fields, and gindeus, and symbolizod
the fertility of namre generally. Eis imagcs were made in a rougn fashion,
and the ancients had but little respect sor him, unhss it were those of the
lowest sort 5 though Horace, who treats him so conoempmously here, speaks
of him elsewhere (Epod. ii. ), in conjunctim with Silvanus, ns receiving the
sacrifice due to him. No oue could better have appreciated than a Roman
of Horace’s way of ‚thinking whether, in respect to this deity or any other,
the ironical description of the prophet Isainh (xliv. 9-20)‚ which may be res
ferred to with advantage. There is no stroke ia the whole of that description
more severe than Horace’s “ incertus scamnum faceretne Priapum Maluit
esse deum.” The figures of Priapus were generally bustu, bnt sometimes
they were full length, of the kind Horace describe& Usually they held a
sickle or a. club in their right hand, by wa of frighoening arienses, and a wisp
of sti-ew, or something· of thaz sort, ω f ⁰ ten the birds. ’

¹ 6. importunas volucres} virgil sppliesntghe same epithet to destructive birds:
“ Obscoenaeqne canes imporpnnneque volucres '' (Georg. i. 4⁷0). The word '
is used with a variety of meanings, to reduce which to one character we must
‚know more than we do of its et mology. .

8. ‘Huc prius anqustiis] See troducn‘on. The poor people were burietl
in ill-(lug graveS, which had the name ‘ puticuli,' probably a form ο( ‘ putei!
'rho manner of their funeral is here stated with painful satire. The poor‘
wretch is neglecoed by his masten and a sellomslave, ont of his ‘ peculium,¹
‘goes to the expense of hiring (‘ locabat ³) ‘ vespillones ⁸ (common corpsez·
hearers, νεκροφόρους) to carry him out on a bicr to the public borini-grounds·
where his eorpse was mssed nnked into a pit inm-which other corpses had
been tossed before. This scene could not have occurred in all its particulam
⁴very often, since every master was bound by law to bury his slave, and if any
=one did it for him, hc was entitled to reeover the eost of the funeral from thes
master of the slave. The '⁴ vilis arca' was called ‘sandapilass a bier of nan
tow dimensions.

11. Pantolabo mmo Μαεηωωᾳαοπφωίε] As to these persone, see note
on S. l. lm. In consequence of their extravagance, Priapus foretells they
will come to a panper's funeral. .

12. Mene pedes vi ftonle‚] This public burial—gmund was 1,ooo feet in·
breadth and 300 in depth. ‘ In fronte' means fac-ing the public und, the Via
Tiburtina (ez-108), or the Vin Praenestina, one of which, or both, must have
,passed very close to it.= (See Caesar, B. G. ii. 8, and Mr. Long's note.) It

Ex τε. (ex testamento) were inserted between n. end u. Such sepulchres·
were called ‘scpulcra fnmiliaria'3 those that were built for a man and his
heire were called ‘ heredimrim' Horace writes as if there were n stone
(‘cippns ') which defined (dabat ') the extent of this burm-ground, and
bore the inscription usual on private monuments, ιι. Μ. 11. Ν. 8., which ie
obviously only a satire. The words could only appl to a private place of
burial. All he really means is, that a space of grean of the extent he men-

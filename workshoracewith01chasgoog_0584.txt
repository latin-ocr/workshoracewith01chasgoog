55. qu cur] The monde which Hm appears to hare used for the first
time have been observed in the course of these notes. These which do noc
appear in an other author are mentioued on O. iii. 11. 10. The constructi&
he here emp o s is unusual, and so illustrares what lie is sayiug. ‘ Ego :h-
videor' ahoul according to usage, be ‘ mihi invideturss as ‘ego impemr ’
should be ‘ mihi imperatur ’ (Epp. i. 5. 21, where sec note).

53. Debentur neon-’u‘ nos uestraque ‚fig Horace probably remembered very wll
the verses of Simonides: .

recemum Terra Neptunus] The ‘ lacus Lucrinus ’ was sepumtssd from the
ba ofoBalae by a narrow causeway, the construction >of which tradition at-
tri uted to Hercules. chond the Lucrinus lay the Avernus lacus (lugo
d’Averno)‚ u busin without- any outlet, about a mile and a kalf in circum-
ference, und fed by streame from Mons Gaurus (Monte Barbam). “rho space
between the two lakes was covered with wood. In the war with Sextus
Pompeius, B. c. 37, Augustus, adv-ised by Agrippa, to whom he had en-
trnsted the task of reforming his ficet, opcncd u. communication beween the
lake& and between lucus Avernus and the nea, whcrebv he made ι har-bor
in which he was nhle to prat-tiso his ships. This he called ‘ portus Juuus?
This is the work Virgil :illudes to (Georg. ii. 161). The basin of the luci-ine
lake has been filled up by the rising of a voloenic hill (Monte Nuovo)‚and is

›S'teryntlisoe diu ραὶιιε] What work Horace here alludcs to is verv dnubtful.
The Scholiasta say that Augustus draincd the Pomptino marshes, That
Julius Coesnr contemplated such a work wc leurn from Suetonius (Cae. 44),
and Plutarch (Caes, 58). Thur. Augustus may have contemplated 3 like-
wise, and made the eannl mentioned on S. i. ⁵2⁷» while that design vas in
his mind, is possible. The cana! extended from Forum Appii to Temeina,
which-is said to have been the length of the marshes ut that time. Horace
appears to he speculating upon a work which, though osten attemped, has
never succceded. ί

67. Sere cursum mraetam‘t] Suetonius tells us that Augustius, to putm end
to the inundatione of the Tiber, cleared out its bed, which had got filla with
rubbish. To some such work as this Horace probably refe-re, in langlage a
little exaggerated.

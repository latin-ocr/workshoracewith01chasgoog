nothing but disaster, and the greater part of the force perished. But Iccius
survi-red, and we find Horace writing to him a few years later as Agrippa's
steward in Sicily (E p. i. 12). Beyond this, nothing is known of iccius.
The Ode is a piece ο good-tempercd, Jocular irony, of which the point lies
in the man of books going forth as a conqueror to subdue fierce nations,
untamed before, and to return laden with the spoils of the East. Later
times have seen young and chivalrous meu hastening to an El Dorado in
expectation of wealth and distinction, and finding nothing but disappoint-
ment3 and such appears to have been the case ou the occasion of this expe-

dition into Arabia.

Ammaia—What, IcciuS, after all, dost thou grudge the· Arabs their
wealth, and prepare chains for the princes of Sabaea and the fierce Mede ’.ἱ
Which of the fair barbarians dost thou mean to bring home for thy bed, or
what royal page for thy table ‘3 Sure, rivers' shall flow back to their moun-
tainS, and the 'siber turn again, if Iccius can desert his books to put on the

bregistplate.

3. Sabaeae] The Romans had possession of parts of Arabia Petraea, but
not of Arabia Felix. ‚Hence Horace sayS, “ Intact1s opulentior Thesauris
Arabum '' (C. iii. 24. 1). It may have been reported that the· army would
proceed against the Parthiam, after the Arabs were conquered, or, as is
mtlm‘ propalam, ‘the ‘ horti-bie lMede ’ is only introduced to heighten the

‘ quae virgo barbara' or ‘ quae virginum barbararum! There is humor in
the question, as if Iccius had only to choose for himself some royal damsel‚
whose betrothed he was to slay with his own hand, and an Eastern page of

to have gathered the substance of his work De Officiis, He professed the .
doctrines of the StoicS‚ but seems to have qualificd them with opinions de'-

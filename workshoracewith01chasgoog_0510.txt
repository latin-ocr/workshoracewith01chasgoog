stroke at him, and is getting ang-ry.

23. antiquae plebis] ‘Plebs ’ has not its distinctive meaning in this place.
(See C. iii. 14. 1, ῃ.) Horace is no doubt touching his own infirmity here.
He was fond of praising the simplicity of the olden time, but he was not the
man to extricate himself trom the degener-ate habits of his own day ζ· nequio-
quam coeno cupiens evellere plantam,’ which is taken from the Greek proverb

ἐκτὸς πηλοῦ πόδα ἔχειν). He had been but lately, perhaps, writing the

praises of a country life, and sighing for his farm (iu the last Satire), but
when there, we. may believe he felt dull enough, and missed the society and
elegances of the city. whatever his ordinary fare ma have been, he had
no objection to the tables of the rich, and was rond to invited to the Es·
quiliae. There is much humor in this part of t e Satire. He is supposed to
be congratulating himself upon being suffered to dine quietly at home, when
he gets an nnexpected invitation from Maecenas to a late dinner. He imme·-

diately shouts for hislantern, sco-lds the servants if they keep him waiting a
moment, and runs off as fast as he can, leaving in the lurch some persons to
whonzhe had promised a dinner, and who. go away disappointed and mutter·
m a use. . ·

{3- sub lumina prima] ‘Immediately after the lighting of the Jmnps?

which he was glad enough, no doubt, to get a cheerful eompanion, like
Horace, to dine with him. ‘Blatero’ is to bawl, or more commonly to
babble and talk nonsense. ‘ Mulvius' may be anybody, one of the numer-
ous tribe of arasites. ‘ Non referenda recati,' uttering ctu-ses which the
’ servants hear , but must not repeat. See fast Satire, v, 30, “iratis precibus.’'
l 37. dixerit ille,] Mulvius may be supposed to matter this, as Horace goes
off and leaves him without his expected dinner. ‘Nasum nidore supinor,'
Ι· 1 snuff up my nose at the smell of a good dinner.' ⁸ Nidor' means ‘nidor
,culinaess as in J uv. v. 162 ; “ Captum te nidore suae putat ille culinae.”

39. εἰ quid vis adde popina] ‘Popino’ is not a common word. It means
{n idle, dissoluto fellow‚ a frequenter of ‘ popinae,’ eook-shops. (See above,

. 4. 62, n, · “ ’

l 40. Tu —)- ultro Insectere] ‘ Are you the man to come forward and attack ’ὲ '
that is, to be the first to do it. See S. 6. 30, and C. iv. 4, 51, n.

Ι 42. Quid, si me] Davus goes on in his own person. Five hundred drach-
mae, reckoning the drachma and the denarius as nearly the same valuo (about
eff), which was the ease about this time, amounts to ΠΙ. 15³. of English Ι

mone , and this was a small price, only given for inferior slaves. The price

,varias very widely, according to the beauty of the slaves (of either sex),
which enhaneed their value more tlian anything else, or according to their
education, or skill in handicrafts, ὣς.

l 43. Auser Me—teffere ,·] Literally, ‘Away with that frightenhg‘ me!
(See Epp. i. 7. 27, n.) It expresses alarm and haste, for Davus sees his
master flowing, and lifting his hand to strike him.

l 45. Crispini docuit me janitor] About Crispinus, see S· i. 1. 1⁶20„n. Davus
rofesses to have obtained at second hand, from the slave of this Stoie phi-
osopher, the arguments he is going to propound. They are put generally,

and he uses his own name; but the pronoun ‘te' means any one. The

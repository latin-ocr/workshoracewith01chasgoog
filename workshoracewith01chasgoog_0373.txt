oons— Boon 1v. 353

Give him the victo , and he will give thee in return a marble statue in a
shrine of citron, wit incense, music, and dancing, in his home by the Alban
lake. Ι have no longer a heart for love and wine, and yet, LigurinuS, why
do 1 weep and dream of thee ’.ἱ -

2. Rursus bella moves ?l See Introduction.

3. Nou sum qualis eram] Epp. i. 1. 4. He here calls Cinara good, be-
cause she is dead3 elsewhere he calls her ‘ rapax ’ (Epp. i. 14. 33). It seems
likely that this name represents a real person, whether she appears under
another name elsewhere or not, and that Horace had an affection for her.
In the thirteenth ode of this book (v. 22) her death is mentioned with feeling,
and there is a reality in the references to her in all the places where she is
alluded to, which cannot be connected with fiction. She, was associated, in
all probability with Horacc's early days. Κυνάρα signifieS‚ some say, a wild
rose-thorn (κυνόσβατος) ; οὲινάρα, an artichoke. ⁶

5. Mater saeva Cupidinum] Repeated from i. 19. 1. Horace here does not
copy himself, I believe, but some Greek original. ‘ Flectere ’ is a metaphor
taken from the breaking in of a horse.

6. lustra] C. ii. 15. 13, n. See Introduction.

' 9. in domum] ‘ More scasonably shalt thou keep thy revels in the house
of Paullus animuS, drawn by Ἣ beautiful swans! So Livy (xl. 7), “ Quin
comissatum ad fratrem imus! ere ‘ comissabere ' is equivalent to ‘ comis-
satum ibis,’ and therefore the reading ‘ in domum ² is‚ correct. Κωμάσδὼ.
ποτὶ τὸν Ἀμαρὖλλιδα is an expression of Theocritus just like this (iii. 1).
Κώμῳ χρὲεσθω ἐς ἀλλήλους occurs in Herodotus (i. 21). ‘Purpureis,’
(which signifies beauty without reference to color) savors of the Greek.
‘ Torrere jecur' is like Theocritus’s ὄπτεῦμενος ἐξ Ἀφροδίτης’(νίἰ. 55).

14. sollicitis non tacitus reis] Compare C. ii. 1. 13, where he calls Pollio
‘¹ Insigne moestis praesidium reiS.'’ ·

15. centum] This is a large definite number for an indefinite. -
‹ultis-363? saynaferet] The idea corresponds to “militavi non sine gloria '’
ιιι. . .

17. Et quandoque] i. e. ‘ whenever, with thine aid, his smiles shall beat the
rich presents of his rival, he shall set thee up in marble, under a citron roof,
by ‚the shore of the Alban lakes‚’ of which there were two close together,
the Albanus (Albano) and Nemorensis (Nemi), and on one of these it

22. Duces murm] ‘Ducere’ is used sor drinking, and here >sor inhaling0'
It has a great variety of meanings, which the context will generally explain.-

28. ter quatient humum] See C. iii. ‘18. 16. On the first few days of
March, during the festival of Mars, the Salii, his priests, went in processioa
through the city singing and danciug, whence they are said to have derived
their name. “Jam dederat Saliis (a saltu nomina ducunt) ’⁹ (Ονίῤ, F. iii.
387). The practice, according to Livy, was instituted by Numa (i. 20), “ per
ἓνοὶὲοὲι ire canentes camina cum tripudiis sollennique saltatione jussi sunt.”

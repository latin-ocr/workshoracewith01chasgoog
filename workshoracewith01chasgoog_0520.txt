ty (fourteen). The boy was a ‘pupillus,' not in relation te his mother, but
to his tutor. Thus ‘ tutela’ and ‘custodia' were different things. ‘ Tutela'
was a technical term, ‘custodia’ was not.

25. locupletibus aequa] ‘Aeque ' is repeated, though not wanted, just as
‘inter ’ is repeated in S. i-. 7, and elsewhere (see note). The Greek writers
used ὁμοίως iu the same way. -

27. Restat ut his] Horace says he is impatient, till he'shall hav'e reached
the per-fection of active virtue and wisdom. But as he has not· done so, it
only remains that he shall regulata and comfort his mind with such‘ elemen-

tary knowledge of truth as he possessos, and be content with that; for, if he ·

cannot reach perihodon, he may make some steps towards it. “ ‘ His ’ means
that which he has at his command. -

28. Νοη possis oculo] The keen sight of Lynceus, one of the Argonauta,

of prodi ious strength. ³ Δ
. 31. odaea -prolaeibere clici-aym] The gout in the hand is called ‘ nodosa'
from its twisting the joints of the fingers (S. ii. 7. 15). As to the construc-
tion of ‘ prohibere,' see C. i. 27. 4.

ι 32. Est quadam prodire tenusl] Horace is probably indulging a little irony
at the expense of the philosop iere, in the implied comparison of their per·
ceptions and powers with those of Lynceus and Glycon, and in the humble
· tone, he takes towards thern. ‘ TenuS,’ as a general rule, takes the ablativo

Philosophv, Horace say-S, has remedies for every discasc of the mind. The
remedies he means are the precepts of the wisc, to be derived from books
(37). He also calls them ‘piacula' (36), which is equivalent to ‘medica-
menta‚’ because, disease being attributed to the wrath os the gods, that which
should remove their wrath (⁶ piaculum ’) was the means of removing disease.
‘ Ter’ is used by way os keeping up the religious notion (that number being

41. Virtus est vitiumfuqere] If you cannot all at once attain perfectior),

away vice. What follows is an illustration of th1s. ‘ You see what trouble
you take to escape from poverty, which you count the worst of all evils; but
if you will only give heed to instruction, you shall learn well to care about
it. This is the sense. As to ‘ repulsa,' see C. iii. 2. 17. He who would

44. capitisque labore] ‘ Caput’ is here putj’ot· the whole body‘. We do

“It is a book sor children ; written not down to them, as some
by mistaken opinion are, but up ς so that it will not be found un·
interesting to the most thou htsul reader. If any one has a
child whom he loves, and in w ose genius he particularly delights
and hopes, let him buy this book, and in an aus icious hour.
perchance when day fades into twilight‚ let him rea one of these
stories to him ‚and he will find out better than from any other
critic their value and their meaning. ”

“ In the opinion of a ‚iury of little oritics to whom the book

was submittent, and whose decisions have considerable weight ·

with us in matters of juvenile literature, Dream Children is
‘ one of the vely best and nicest’· books of its class, and it occu-
pxes a place o honor on the children’s she1s.”

“ Dream Children is as ideal and imaginative as childhood
itself. Whoever reads it, no matter of what age. will be morally
elevated and refined at beholding the beautiful exposition of
what is most lovely in humanity enacted in the world of flowers
and animal& The sense of what we read is twofold more affect-

ing when we can see our‘very selves through the thin vell os ,

sabb, saia-y, and allegor-y. This is a book which one would de·
light in reading to his child, alone, in some quiet. large arm-chain· :
or if he had no child, to make him wish that he had ; for it is of‘
that character os excellence to so contuenti itsels, you wish
everybody to know and have it.'’

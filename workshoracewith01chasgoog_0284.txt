ODE XVIII.⁴

Tms is a translation or close imitation of an ode of Aleaeus in the same
'metre,‘ one verse of which is almost litei-aug translated in the first verse of

this Ode, μηθὲν ἄλλο φυτεύσῃς πρότερον ’ἐνδρευν ἀμπέλω. It rofesses
,to be addressed to a friend who is makin a plantation near his ouse at
Tibur. The friend's name is Varus, and {liat was the eoo‘nomcn of Quinc-
tilius, whose death is lamen'ted in C. 24 of this book. ‘hut whether this
‘is the person intended or not it is impossible to say, and itdoes not signis y,
since the scene is most probably imaginary. Varus is advised to fiant the
vine before all other treeS, since wine, ii used in moderation, drives care
gwazy, though if abusecl its attendants are strife, sels-love, vainglory, and
. ro en ait

Anemmur. -The vine is the first tnee thou shouldst plant, VaruS, by
the walls of Tibur. Hardships are only for the sober3 wine drives away
all cares. Who speaks of battles and poverty‚ rather than of Bacchus and·
¹,V enus, when heis under the influence ,of wine-2 But that no man excecd,
let him think of the bloody frays of the Centaure and Lapithas, and of
the Thracians, over their cupS, when the appetite confounds right and wrong.
1 ’ll no't muse thee unbidden, beautiful BassareuS, nor drag thy mysteries
'fmm their secret places. Sileuce the horn aud drum, whose followers are
. vainglory and broken faith. .

, 2. muris et moenia cotila] See C. i. 7. 13, n. Horace shortens the penulti-
mate syllable of Catillus's name for the sake of the metre, and the same
liberty is taken with the name of Porsenna, Epod. xvi 4 ·

, 4. aliter] By any. other means than wine, which is not expressed, but
sufficiently im lied in ⁴ siccis)

6. te' potius, A verb must be understood more suitable than ⁸ erepat,'
which is equivalent to ‘ croakS,’ >or something of that εοιτ.. ⁸ Laudat ’ or
‘canit ' may be supplied. ·

8 super mero} ‘ over their wine,' that is, while they were drinking.
‘ Super' with the ablative generally means ‘ about,' ‘ on behalf σίζ’ or ⁸ con-
cernmg,' a thing ; but it is also used to express time, asin Aen. ix. 61 we
have ⁸ nocte super media! The story is, that at the marriage-feast of Pei·
rithouS, king of the Lapithae, the CentaurS, being guestS, attempted in their
drunkenness to carry off the bride, Hippodamia, and the other women
present, which led to a battle, in which the Centaure were beaten.

9. Sithoniis non Ievis Euius] The Sithonians were a pcople of Thrace, on ·
the boi-ders of the Euxine. Bacchus was angi-y with the Thraciam, and
visited habitual drunkenness upon them, because their king, Lyeurgus, sor·
bade the cultivation of the vine. See C. i. 27. l, sq.

10. Cum sas atque nefas] ‘ Cum ' refers to ‘ super mero.’ ‘When the
greed of wine distinguish between right and wrong by the slender line of
'their usts,' that is, the slender distinction that ,lust so inflamcd can draw.

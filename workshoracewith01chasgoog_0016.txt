With him he learnt grammar, the earlier Latin authors, and
Homer. He‘ attended other masters (of rhetoric, poetry, and
musio perhaps), as Roman boys were wont, and had the advan-
tage (to which he afterwards looked back with gratitude) of his
father’s care and moral training during this part of his education.
It was usual for young men of birth and ability to be sent to
Athens, to finish’ their education by the study of Greek literature
and philosophy ‚under native teachers3 and Issorace -wenff there
too, at what' age is not known, but probably when he was about
twenty. Whether his father was alive at that time, or dead, is
uncertain. If he went -to—-Athens at twenty, it was in B. 'c. 45,
the year before Julius Caesar was assassinated. After that
event, Brutus and Cassius left Rome and went to Greece. Fore-

seeing the struggle that was before them, they got round them
many of the young men at· that time studying at AthenS, and³
Horace was appointed tribune* in the army of BrutuS, a high
command, for which he was not qualified. He went with Brutus
into Asia Minor, and finally shared his defeat at Philippi, Β. 0.

Pompeius Varus (ii. 7). After the battle he came to Italy, hav-

willing to give up a desperate cause and settle quietly at home.
His patrimony,† however, was forfeited‚ and he seems to have

into notice,‡ rather than for the purpose of making money by
their sale. By some means he managed to get a place as scriba§
in the Quaestor's offic'e, whether by purchase or interest does not ap-
pear. In either ease, we must suppose ‘he contrived soon to make
friends, though he could not do so by the course he pursued,

‡ Some persons reject this notion‚ supposing Horace to mean, in the pas-1
sage on which it ἱεὶιιιῐιᾱθᾱ (Epp. ii. 2. 51), that poverty made him desper-

rich he lost t'hat stimuluS. ’

by the hand, and said, “ 1 have need of thee still ”3 and he detained him a
whole year, sayin'g, “ Silence, too, hath its safe rewardss’ Horace's¹ indigna-
tion is levelled against the breaking of saith generally, and the divulging of
the secrets of Ceres (whose ἠως, however, it uppem-S, were only attended
by women) is only mentioned by way of illustration. Seereey is a sign of
good saith, and not an easy one to praetise. There are few moral qualities
that can be said to take precedenee of it. It is thebaeis of friendship, as
Cicero sayS‚ and without lt society cannot exist. (Compare S. i ‘²2⁸⁴’ n.)
It is probable, if Plutareh's story be true, that. Horace had heard Augustus
repeat his faron-ite axiom-

26, ete] ‘I will not. suffer the person who has divulged the sacred mys-
terifis of Ceres to be under the same roof, or to sail in the same vessel,
wit me.’

were no mysteries among the'Romans corresponding to the Eleusiniam or

any os the other Greek Μυστὴρια. ,

ODE 111.

. 'Plus Ode commende the virtue of persever-auce by the example of heroes
who had secur-ed divine honors by it. Juno is introduced as making a long
speech to the assembled gode, when it was proposed to admit Romulus
. among them. 'This speech is contrived in ordei· to introduce the glory and
extent of the Roman empire and the praises of Augustus, It also contains
indii-ectr exhortatione to abstinence and eontentment, and so bears on the
general scope of these Odes. It is said that Julius Caesar meant. to transfer
the seat of empine to Alexandria in Troas, or to Ilium ; and perhaps in
Horaee's time, among the remedies proposed sor the evils of the state, some
may have freely spoken of transferring the seat of government to another
spot. It is equally probable that the site of Troy, the city of their aneestors
and the fountain of their race, may have been fixcd upon for that purpose.
To meet the spirit of avarice in some, and restlessness in all that would be
mixed up with such a notion, seems to have been another purpose of this
Ode. The Romans attached much importaneo to the legend which derived
their origin from the Trojans. See S. ii. 5. 63.

Attenuant—The upright man and firm no teri-ors⁴ ean drive from his
urpose. Throngh this virtue Pollux, Hercules, AugustnS, BacchuS‚ hare

thus addressed the assembled gods: “Ilium hath paid the penalty of its
founder’s crime. That impious umpire and his foreign strumpet have over-

war-our uarrels protracted is at au end. My wrath then I remit. Let Mars
have his ated grandson ; let him come among us: only let seas roll between
Dium and Rome, and let the exiles reign where they will ; let their capitol stand,
and the Mede own their away 3 but let the tomb of Priam andos Paris be the,

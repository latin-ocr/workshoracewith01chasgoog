12. Si parcent animae] Cic. ad Fam. (xiv. 14): f‘ Vos meae carissimae
§nimae quam saepissime ad me scribite.'' Since ‘ metuam ’ here and ‘patiar ’
velow (v. 15) are the present subjunctive, ‘parcent‚' following those words,
should, in strict Latinit , be ‘parcant' But the same eonstruction occurs
above (C. iii. 3. 7). Wyhy Chloe should be a Thracian, and Ornytus of
Thurii (see S. ii. 8, 20, n.), is not worth questioning.

ι 17 ,0 prisfq] Forcellini gives other instanees of this use of ‘ priscu3‚' where
pil-ignata 39131(ὶῖῗῦᾝὲ 1ἰε governed by ‘ eogit‚' and ‘ diductos ² stands alone,
‘ parted though we be.' ,

19. excutitur] The English “ cast off '’ expresses the meaning best.

22. improbo] On the meaning of ‘improbus’ as a word expressing ‘ex-
eess,' see below (C. iii2 24. 62). Here it means ‘ violent‚' ‘t'urious.’

ODE X.

Tms is supposed to be sung by a lover under the window of his mistress,
who on a eold night refuses him admission. It is what the Greeks called a

we may suppose Horace had some poem of the sort in his mind when he
wrote this. The thirteenth Ode of the fourth book is nominally connected
with this; but as there is no necessity for supposing, nor any likelihood, that
Horace wrote this from his own experience, so neither is it likely that he
wrote ssfft to taunt in her decline the girl who is supposed to reject his ad·-
dresses ere.

- Auentinum -· Were Scythia thy dunning-place, Lyce, this inclement
night should move thee to pity me. Hear how the wind howls3 see how the
snow lies freezing. Venus loves ·not pride: the rope may break and the
wheel run back3 though nothing bends thee, neither presente, nor prayerS,
nor these sallow eheeks of mine, nor thy husband's faithlessneSS, though thou

be hard as the oak and cruel as the serpent, yet as a goddess have pity!
Flesh and blood will not stand this for ever. .

2. Saevo nupta viro,] ‘ wedded to a barbarian husband.'

3. objicere incolis] ‘ thou wouldst grieve to expose me to the north-winda
that there have their home.’ ,

5. nemus Shrubs and flowers were sometimes planted round the implu-
vium of a oman house, but more largely in the peristylium‚ which was an
open space at the back part of the house, surrounded by colonnades, and, like

the impluvium, usually having a cistern or fountain in the middle. ‘ Remu· ·

giat ventis,’ ‘echoes baek to the winds their howling.'
7. ut ylaciet] Itis easy tosupply ‘videS,' or ‘sentiS,’ ,or any other word
more appropriate than ‘ aud1s ' to the freezing os the snow. One verb of

sense is often made to serve for two or three. ‘ How Jove with his bright ”

power freezeth the snow as it lies! ‘Jove ’ is the atmosphere (see c.i.1.
25, n.). ‘ Puro ’ is a good epithet to express a clear frosty night.

10. Ne currente,retro simis eat rota] ‘Lest the wheel turn back and the
rope with it: ‘ retro ' applying to both ‘curuente ' and ‘ eat.' The metaphor
is taken from a rope wound round a cylindcr, which being allowed to run

back, the rope runs ‘¹⁰‘ss {nd the weight or thing attached goes with it. The

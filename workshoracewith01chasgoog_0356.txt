⁸ to heard,’ which was commonly done to mise the price. ‘ Meis ' is ein-
phatic, as ‘ proprio horreo ’ (i. l. 9). 1

29. Parae rivus aquae] The small river Digentia is that which Horace
'alludes to (see Epp. i. 16). On ‘certa fides’ see C. iii 1. 30, n. ‘Fallit
beatior' is a⁸ Greek construction, λανθάνει ὀλβιώτερον ὅν. Horace sayn,
‘ Mine is a hap ier lot than his who has all Africa for his possession, though
he knows not t t it is so.' The construction is like “sensit medios delapsus
in hostes ’² (Aen. ii. 377), for ‘ se delapsum esse! ³

33. Calabrae—apes] See C. ii. 6. 14, n, ’,

34. Laestryyouia-amplzoml This is used like ‘ Sabina diota,’ which was
the same sort of vessel (C. i. 9. 7), ‘an amphora of Formian wine.’ The
inhabitants of Formiae in Latium supposed it to be the same as the Laestry-
‘genia mentioned by Homer (Odyss. x. 81), -.

ἑβδομάτῃ δ’ ἱκόμεσθα Λάμου αἰπὺ πτολίεθρον,

τηλὲπυλον Λαιστρυγονίην. · ·
See Introduction to the next Ode, and Ovid (Met. xiv. 233) :—

“ {nde-Lami veterem Laestrygonia inquit, in urbem
emmus.”

‘ Languescere ’ means ‘to lose its strength by keeping! The Formian wine
is mentioned, C. i. 20, 11. The pastui-e lands in the basin·of the· Po (ἦ Gal-
lica pascua ') were very extensive and rich.

38. Nec si plura velim} Compare Epod. i. 31 : “ Satis superque me benig-
‘nitas tua Ditavit.’' There was a Mygdonia in Mesopotamia, and Bithynia is
said to have been called by that name of old. The Mygdonia of ,Asia
Minor ( art of Macedonia was also so called) was not very clearly defined.
That orace identifies it with Phrygia appears from C. ii. 12. 22. ‘Aly-
attei ’ is the genitive of ‘Alyatteus,' another form of ‘Alyattes ’ (king of
Lydia), as Achilleus -ei of Achillae, Ulixeus -ei of Ulixes, ‘Vectigalia '
means properly the public revenue, but is here used for a private fortune,
'not without reason, as he is comparing himself with kingS. See S. ii. 2.
100, n. .

42. Multa, petentibus] The same sentiment in different words appears
below (C. iii. 24. 63). ‘Bene est·’ occurs again iu S. ii. 6. 4, 8. 4. Ep'p. i.
. 1. 89. It is familiai-ly known in the. formula e. v. B. Ε. v. (‘ si‘ valeas bene est,
valeo ’), which the Romans prefixed to their letters. ⁴

' ODE xvu.

Tne short Ode, C. i. 26, and this Ode, were addressed to the same person,
L. Aelius Lamia (see Introduction to C. i. 26). He was a young man of
good. birth, being of the Aelia gens, who were plebeians, but of old standing.
Like other families, the Lamia> were, perhaps, glad to trace their origin to a
fabulous hero, and believed their founder to be LamuS, mythical king of
the Laestrygonians, and builder of Formiae, whence they must have mig-rab.
ed to Rome (see last Ode, r. 33, n.). Horace had an affection for the young
man, Lamia, whose father was a friend of Cicero’S, and ‘died rich. It
is not improbable that the Ode was written at his house in the country, '
whether at Formiae or elsewhere. It is an exhortation to Lamia to make
preparations for enjoying a holiday on the next day. The verses have no
particular merit, and could have eost Horace little labor. He must have
written many such that have never been published, and these two Odes were

robably included in the collection out of compliment to Lamia. Lamia
Eud a brother· Quintus, ,who died early, to the great grief of Lucius, (see

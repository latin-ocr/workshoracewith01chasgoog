ODE XXX.

11· is not improbable that the main incident of this Ode, that of a lady
sacrificing or dedicating a little chapel ω VenuS, is taken suom life; but
there is α’ fragment of one of Alcman’s poenis, running Κύπρον ἱμερτὰν
gin-oica καὶ Πάφον περίῤῥυτον, which- appears to have been imitated 'in the

rst two verses. · ·

Auamma—Royan Venus, leave thy beloved CypmS, and corne, dwcll
in Glycera's temple. Let Love come with thee, and the Graces and Nympha,
and Youth, who is unlovely without thee, and Mercury too. .

l. Cnidi Paphique,] See C. 3. 1, n. -
. 4. aedem] The humblest houses had their little chapel‚ set apart for au
mggedum Gratiae zonis] The oldest painters and sculptors represented the
Graces clothed; afterwards it became the fashion to represent them nakod ;
but the latest practice lay between the two, and they were painted and sculp-
tured with loose, transparent drapery: Horace varies in his descriptions.
See C. i. 4. ὃς iii. 19.16; iv. 7. 6.

7. Et parum comis sine te Juventas] Cupid (‘ fervidus puer ') or several

Cupids (C. 19. l), Youth (Ἥβη), Hei-mee, the god of eloquence, Pei-suasion

(Πειθώ), and the Graces, were the principal companions of Venus, accord·
ing to the notions of the Greeks. The nymphs of the woods, or of the hius,
were likewise usually represented as her companionS. (See C. iv. ὃ.)

 

ODE XXXI.

In B. c. 28 (25th October), Augustus dedicated a temple, with-a library
attached, which he had built in honor of Apono, on the Palatine Hill, to
commemorate his victory at Actium. After the ceremonies of the day of
dedication were over, we may suppose Horace putting in his own claim to
the god's favor in this Ode, in which he represents himself as offering a
libation (whether in private or at the temple is uncertain), and asking for
that which, according to Juvenal (x. 356), should be the end of all prayer,
‘ mens sffna in corpore sano! ' .

⁵ Auentinum—What asks the poet of Apollo? Not cups, or hen-bs, or
gold and ivory, or rich fields. Let those who may prune Calenian vines,
and ri& merchants drink rich wine out of cups of gold, favorites of heaven,
who traverse the deep in saffity. My food is the olive, the chicory, and the
mallow. Let me enjoy what 1 Jiasge, thou son of Late, sound in body and
mind, and let my age pass with honor and the lyre-

1. dedicatum] This word is applied to the god as well as his temple.
So Cic. de N. Ι). ἰί. 33, says, ‘⁴ ut Fides ut Mensquas in Capitolio dedicatas-
vidimus proxime a M. Aemilio Scauro.'’

2. novum} Libations were made with wine of the current year.

4. Sardiniae] This island ‘supplied much of the corn consumcd at Rome.
‘Fet-ax ' is properly applied to the soil which produces; here it is said of
the produce itself, and means ‘ abundant.’

5. Οαὲιὶὶὺὲἒαε] ξῗὴετθ floeks were pastured in the winter season. C. ii.
6.10. .i.2,n. · ⁰

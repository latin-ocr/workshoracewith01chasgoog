· war-ds, we find him celebrating the anniversary of his escape with a sacrifice
-to Liber (C. iii. 8. 6), and in the l'i'th Ode-of this book (v. 321 he speaks of
offering a lamb to Faunus for his preservation.

. The latter part of . the Ode is a remarkable instance of Horace's way of
digressing into subjects onl remotely connected with his principal theme.
In speaking of hiseseape, he is led into a descriptiones the company he
should have been brought into if he had been sent so suddenly to Hades,
dwelling particularly on Alcaeus and Sappho, and the power of their music
over the spirits of the dead.

Auentinum—Whoever planted thee, thou trae, did so on an evil day;
and with impious hand he reared thee. Parricida, guest-murder‚—there is
no crime he would ‘not commit. No one ean provide against all dangers.
’ The sailor fears the sea, and nothing else; the soldier fears his ,enemy alone ;
but death comes often from an unexpeetcd source. How nearly was 1· sent
to the regions below, where all the shades wonder, Cerberus listenS, the
Furiffllm chax-med, and the damned suspend their labom, while Sappho
and caeus sing. ·

1. nefasto] A ‘dies nefastus ' was properly one on which, the day being
dedicated to religion, it was not lawful for the praetor to hold his court. O‘vid
thus defines ‘dies fasti ' and ‘ nefasti ’ (Fast. i. 47) :—

“ Ille nefastus erit perquem tria verba silentur;
F astus erit per quem lege licebit agi '' ;

where the three words alluded to are said to be ‘ d0,' ⁶ dieo,’ ‘addieo,’ all of
them familiar and of common occurrence in Roman civil procedure. Hence
the name, which is compoundcd of ·' ne ' and ⁴ fari.' And, because no secu-
lar work but what was necessary could prosper on the days called ‘ nefasti,'
all unlucky days came to bear. that name as here; and the word was thence
applied to express all that was bad. as C. i. 35. 35. The words may be ren·
dered, “he not only planted thee on an evil dav (whoever it was that first
planted thee), but with impious hand neared thee? The ‘ pagus’ was Man·
dela, in a valley of the Sabine hills, where Horace had his farm.

6. ‘Frqqz‘sse cervicem] This is the ordinary phrase for strangulation. It
occurs again Epod. iii. 2. The force of ‘penetralia' is. that in the inner
part of the house- the images of the, Penates and the hearth of Vesta were
placed, where, if. anywhere‚ the person of a guest should he sacred. .

10. Tractavit,] This word is sufficient for both substantives. There is no
necessity for supplying ‘patravit' for ‘nefas,' as Orelli says. ‘I'he word
‘ tractare ' is widely applied.

ll. caducum] This word signifies ‘falling' (iii. 4. 44), ‘sallem’ or ‘ready
to fall) More generally the last, as here. Virgil has (Aen. vi. 481) ε “ Hic
¹¹}fflmm, fleti ad superos belloque caduci Dardanidae '''; where it means
‘ allen. ·

14. in homa] ‘from hour to bour!

'Bos-porum] The form ,οἲ “ the Greek βοῦς πόρος requires that the name'
should be written thuS‚ and not Bosphorum, as it is often spelt. The Phoe-
nicians were proverbial as sailors, and the name is so used here. .

17. celeremsuyam] C. i. 19. ll, n. The defeat of Crassus by the P-ar-
thians, Β. c. 55, and of M. Antonius, Β. c. 36, left a deep and long impres-
sion on the Romans. . , .

18, 19. catenas—et Italum Robur-5] ‘ the bonds and the prowess of the Βοὴ,
man! Among the things which the Roman soldier carried to battle with
him (an axe, a saw, διο.) was a chain to secure any prisoner he might take.
To this llorace probably refers in ‘ catenas? and below in C. iii. 8. 22.

21. siu-vae reqna Proserpinae] ‘ Furvus ' is an old word signifying ⁸ dark‚'
and is not different from ‘ salvuS,’ except in usage. It is much used in con-

44. Chrysippi porticus] This was the στοὰ ποικίλη or picture-gallery at
Athens, in which Zeno first taught, and from which his followers derived
their name. The Stoics admitted no mean between perfect wisdom, or virtue;
and absolute folly, or vice. The fool, therefore, was a madman, and he was
a sool who was ignorant of the truth: and this maxim (‘formu1a’) applies to
all‘ men except the sage; the sage, therefore, is he who is perfectly acquainoed-
with the truth‚ which is the Stoic‘s’ equivalent for a vii-tuous man. This‘
theory of virtue led to the doctrine of punishments ridiculed by Horace in the
third Satire of the first book. The Steics allowed no gradations of virtue,t
and therefore admitted no gradations of punishment. Their notion ofa sago
altogether was irrational, because no such being as they imagined a sage to
be ever existed, and they· did not suppose it possible he should. Their intem:
tion was good, namely, to put before the world the highest standard of virtue,
'wisdom, and sels-control, and, by withholding all credit from any stage short
of perfeetiom to lead men on to desire pei-fection. ' ¹ ·-

Est yemis unum] This is the first class of fools, those who are afraid where
no fear is: the second being those who care nothing for danger. Compare

Polymestor‚ king of Thrace, and murdered by him for his gold. Another
legend (see Dict. Biog. ‘ Polydorus ') makes him intrusted to the care of his'
sister Ilione, who was wife of the above Polymestor. She, for some reason,

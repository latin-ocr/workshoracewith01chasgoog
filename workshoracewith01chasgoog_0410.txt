, 6. barbaram 9] Phrygian, for which this was a common equivalent, aa op-

scd to Grecian. So (Epp. i. 2. 7) : “ Graecia barbariae lento colliso duello.’‘

peius was efeated by Agrip off NaulochuS, on the coast of Sicil , B. c. 36,

a person who was not ‘ sui juris ’ was transferred to the ‘ potestas ' of another,
as in the case of adoption. ‘ Emancipare' seems to be the proper term to

of the words, which it is not easy to trace. ,
’ 13. Fert vallum et arma] ‘ Valli ’ were stakeS, >of which every soldier car· ,

ried one or two for the purpose of defending the ‘ agger ’ or mound of earth,
formed round an encampmcnt or a besieged town. ‘ Arma. ' includes not only
his weapons of offence and defence, but an axe, sam, chain, etc. The accou-
trements of a Roman soldier were very heavy, but they had slaves (‘ calones ')
who helped to carry' them. See C. ii. 13. 18, n.

20. sinistwrsum citae] This is probably a nautical term. The Greeks had

an expression πρῦ νην κροῇσασθαιι ‘to back water? Something of that
sort, connected wit fli ht, is probably the meaning of ‘ sinistrorsum citae?

25. fflsuper Karthayinem] All that is here said about Scipio’s tomb is,
that his valor built him one on the ruins of Carthage, which is no more thau
a repetition of C. iv. 8. 17. Horace is speaking of a tomb of reuown, in
which Scipio’s memory is enshrined, not his body. ‘

mist-ress Glycera as 'a flower-girl, Στεφανηπλόκος. Ηο flourishc’d about the
middle of the fourth century n. c. ‘ Tot-pes ' is a like expression to that in
S. i. 43 28, “ stupet Albius aere '² 3 and 6. 17, “ Qui stupet iu titulis et imagi-
nibus. ' ο “

96. Fulvi Rutubaeque Aut Pacideiani] These are all names of gladiators,
as we may gather from the context. Pliny tells us it was the practice, when
shows of gladiators were exhibited‚ for the exhibitor 10501 forth-a picture of
the games, to inform the public, such as we see now of conjurors, circus, arrd
the like; and these are what-Davus alludes to. They were done, no doubt,
mughly, as he describes. Cicero mentions repeatedly a gladiator named
Pacideianus. Horace -may have taken 1110 name for any gladiator in conse·
queuce of the celebrity of this man. ‘ Contento poplite ’ represents the' atti-
tude of the gladiators. The Scholiasts raise a doubt upon the point, think·
ing the words may apply to the spectator stretching himself on tiptoe to get
a nearer vleW. .

101. adiicias audis] See S. 6. 20, n., and 3. 23: “Callidus huie signo
ponebam millia centum.'’

103. coenis restmnsat opimis] ‘ Responsat ' seems here 10 have the sense of
‘corresponds to, as ‘responsura' in S. 8. 66. What Davus says amounts
to this: ‘ 1 am good for nothing, because I am attracted by a cake just hot
from the oven ; you, forsooth, are virtuous and noble, because you feast upon
good things! So the same opposition appears in these lines as in the two
before. ‘ Libum ' was a coarse sort of cake made of pounded eheese, eggs,
and fleur, all mixed together and baked. There was another sort used in
sacrifice, concerning which see Epp. i. 10. 10, n.

105. Qui tu impunitior] Persius 1105 copied this way of Speaking (v. 129) :-

“ Sed si intus et in jecore aegro
Nascuntur domini, qui tu impunitior exis ,
Atque hic quem ad strigiles scutica et metus egit herilis? ’'

110. Furtim mutat 51νὶρὶίί ε] Α5 to the construction with ‘ muto,’ see C. i.
17. 2. The ‘strigil,’ which the Greeks called στλεγγίς. was a seraper of
bone or metal, of a curved form and with a sharp cdge, with which the skin
was scra ed after bathing, or exereise in the gymnasium. ⁴ .

1122 on horam tecum esse pota3,] · To a man who has no resources in him-

 

self, or is afraid of his own conscience or his own thoughts, and resorts to '

“ amusements or other means of disti-action to divert his mind, these words ap-
ply. ‘ Tecum habita,’ inhabit your own 1110051, make that your home, is a
like expression of Persius, S. iv. 52.

113. suffitibus et erro‚] ‘Fugitivus' was a slave who ran .away outright ς
‘erro ' was an idle fellow, who skulked out of the way, to escape work or to
amuse himself. There was the same distinction in the army between ⁶ deser-
tor' and ‘emansor.’ A ‘fugitivus ' was branded on the forehead, and hence
110 was termed ’1110101003 ‘ notatus,' ‘ inscriptus,’ ⁴ stigmosus ’ς ⁴ stigma'
being the word to express the mark thus given. See above, S. 5. 15. n.

116. [hade milei lapidem ἲ] See above, S. 5. 102, 0. Horace is supposed
to get angry beyond endurance at- this home-thrust of his slave, and calls out
for a stone, arrows, anything‚ to throw at his head. The man is bewildercd
with fear, and thinks his master has· gone mad, unless, which was as good,
110 was making verses. He is, οι· affects to be, unconscious of 1110 lieense he·
has given himself, and the force of the truths he has been telling.

118. accedes olm-a aym ηοηα] This means, ‘ 1 will send you away to work
with the other slaves (of whom therefore he appears to have had eight), at
my farm.’ It was a common punishment, as it is now in slave countries, for
a slave to be turned out of the ‘familia urbana,' into the ‘familia rustica,’
and set to work in the fields. See Terence (Phorm. ii. 1. 19), where Geta
lpoks fot-ward to being punished in the above manner 1·-

of Pinda ‘s poetry. ι . ⁶
— cumctdo‘] Plus maz mean either the chanot (formed from ‘ curro,' as

‘ vehiculum' rom ‘ veho or the course.
4. cblleyisse] The perfect is used to express the frequent repetition of the

action, like the Greek aorist. The best iliustration of what follows is in the ι

Iliad (xxiii. 338, sqq.). ‘Meta’ was the cenical pillar at the end of the
course round which the chariots turned on their way back to the stan-ting-

place. By the Greeks it was called νύσση. It was the mark of a skilful
driver to turn the goal as closely as possible without touching it, which is
implied in ‘ fervidis Evitata rotis,

6. Terrarum dominos] That is, the Romans. Virgil (Aen. i. 282) calls
them “ Romanos rerum ,dominqsl' ·

8. teryeminis] This *refers to the three curule magistracies, those of the·

aedile, praetor, and consul. Though the quaestorship was usually the first
step in the line of promotion, it is not included, because it was not a curule
office. ‘ Tergeminus ' here significa no mqre than ‘ triplex! ‘ Geminus ' is
used in this combination with cardinal numbers frequently. So Virgil
(Aen. vi. 287) calls Biiareus ‘ centumgeminus! ‘ Honoribus is the ablativo
case, as’ (C. i. 21. 9.) ε “ Vos Tem'pe totidem tollite laudibus-'² Tae. Anu. i. 3 ε
“ Claud-ium Marcellum pontificatu et curuli aedilitate -Μ, Agrippam gemi-
natis consulatibus extulit.” ·

Cer-tat -tollerel The poets, following the Greek idiom, nse for conven-
ience and conciseness this construction of the infinitivo with verbs, which in
prose would require ‘ ut’ with the subjunctive, or a supine, or ‘ ad ' with a
gei-‚und or some other construction. In the nent Ode we have “ &it visere” 3
m the latii, “ sumis celebrare '’ ; in the 26th, “ tradam ortam, - and so on.
Verbs of all ,kinds signifying desire and th reverse are> requently used with
the infinitive, as inthis Ode: “demere spernit,'’ “refugit .tendere ”5 C. 9.
13, “ngss quaerere,’' &e Propertius uses the infinitive after ‘ire‚' which
the prose writers never do: “Ibat et hirsutas illc videre ‚feras '’ (i. 1. 12).

10. de Libyci? verritur areis] The great mass of the corn consumcd at
Rome was imported from Sicily and Lib a. See C. iii. 16. 26, 31. S. ii. 3.
87. The ‘ area ' was a raised floor on w iieh .the corn was threshed3 and,
after the wind had winnowed it, the floor was swept, and the corn was thus
collkected. ‘See Yirgil (.Georg..i. 178, sqq.), where directions are given sor

11. Jindere sarculo] There is something of contempt in these ποι-(18, where
we should have expected ‘arare’ The soil must be poor that was worked
by a hoe, and the owner ‘macro pauper agello! (Epp. ii. 2. 12.) ‘ Scin-
dere ’ is the proper word ,for .the lough ; ‘ findere,' fo'r the hoe or lesser in-
struments. — ‘ Attalicis conditioni us ’ signifies ‘ the most extravagant terms.’
There were three kin s of Pergamus of this name, which was proverbial for
riches. The third leg his great wealth to the Romans (3.0. 134). See Ο. ii.

peffgniffinffivggsgumffiggitghggngtgssfflgxgpt‘de: ‘ down from: ‘ demoveo ’ is
more properly used when the place from which the removal takes lace is
expressed‚ and ‘ dimovco ’ when the sentence is absolute, as here. or in-
stance, ‘ demovet' is the roper reading in C. iv. 5. 14 ε “ vCurvo nec faciem
littore demovet.'' The 3188. have in many instaures ‘ dimovet ’ where
‘ demovet ’ is wanted. The same remark applies to ‘ diripio ’ and ‘ deripio'
— ‘ Cypria,' ‘ Myrtoum,’ ‘Icariis ' (C. iii. 7. 21), ‘ Afficum,' are all particular
names for general, as ‘ Bithyna carina ' (C.,i. 35. 7 ). By adding names more
life is given to the description. — Horace’s epithets for AfricuS‚ which was

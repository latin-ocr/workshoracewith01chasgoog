20. ambitiosior] This is the only passage in which the word occul-sin this
sense of ‘ clinging‚' the nearest to ‘ ambire ² in its primitive meaning.

 

ODE XXXVII.

Tna occasion that gave rise to this Ode, and the time therefore of its com-
position, ane sufficiently clear. Intelligence of the deaths of M. Antonius and

' Cleopatra was brought to Rome in the autumn of Β. c. 30, and on this occa-

sion Horace wrote the following Ode, which is directed chiefly against cleo-
ptati-Ia.i{loracehi21ilpeags tzith‘tage started with an ode of Alcaeus on the death

με ,νῦν χρὴ μεθῗσθην καί τινα πρὸς βίαν

e πίνην ἐπειδὴ κάτθανε Μῦ σιλος.

The histor-isal facts referred to may be gat ered from Plutarch's Life of M.
Antonius. '

Anemurium. —·’T is time to drink‚ to smite the earth, and set out a feast
for the gods, my friends. We might not bring down the Caecuban, while that
mad queen with her foul hcrd was threatening Rome with destruction. But
her fury is humbled, her sseet in flameS, her drunken hem-t shook with fcar
when Caesar hunred her fmm Italy, as the hawk pursues the dove or the
hunter the hare, to chain the accursed monster ; who fcared not the sword nor
fled to secret hiding-places‚ but chose to die, rather than submit to be led in
triumph by the conqueror.

‚ 2. nanc Saliam-ihm] A Saliaric ,banquet is a rich banquet, fit for the Salii,
the priests of MarS. The feasts of the Pontifices were proverbial ‚for profu-
sion. On great occasions, a.banquet was set out, in place of a sacrifice, and

3. ρῃὶυἰηαν] roperly, the cushion of the conch, and so put here for the
ωὲῗὴῶῗηῗιξε erat] This imperfect tense seems to mean that this was the
time that the‘Fates had intended for such festiviticS. Ovid (Tr. iv. 8. 24, sq.)
has it twice over in this unusual way : —
“ Sic igitur tarda vires minuente senecta
Me quoque donari jam rude tempus erat3
Tempus erat ncc me peregrinum ducere caelum
Nec siccam Getico fonte levare sitim.''

The (ἓξθθὶω used the imperfect ἐχρῆν in the same undefined way. See note
on i. 2 . 19. .

6. cellis] The ‘ cella' was, properly speaking, a chamber, partl above
and partly under ground, in which the ‘ dolia ' were kept'. That in w ich the'
‘ am horae ' were stored was called ‘ apotheca,' and was in the upper part of
the ouse: hence the terme, ‘ depromere,' ‘ deripere‚' ‘descendere' ⁹ ‘ Capi-
tolio ' is equivalent to ‘ urbi.’ See C. iii. 3. 423 iii. 30. 8. ‘ Imperio ³ is used
for the sovereign power of Rome, as in C. iii. 5. 4. .

7. Reyina dementes ruinas] ‘ Dementes ' is transferred from ‘ regina' to
‘minas’ as in Virg. (Aen. i1. 576): “ Ulcisci patriam et sceleratas sumere
poenas,'’ where ‘ sceleratas ' expresses the guilt of Helen.

9. Contaminata cum yreqe turpium Movbo viror-urm] ‘ with her filthy hcrd of
men (forsooth) foul with discsse) The corrupt lusts of that class of persons
who were most about an Eastern queen, are firopcrly called a disease. ‘ vi-

mrum ' is used ironically. In Epod. ix. ll, orace complains :--

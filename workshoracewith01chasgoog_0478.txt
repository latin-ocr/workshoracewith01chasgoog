yon find better objects to spend it 001 ’ , ⁹ ·=
- 103. indiynus] This has the same sense as ‘immeritus' (C iii.·6. 1,-and
elsewhere), ‘innocent.' Forcell. gives other examples. As to the state of

³ . iii. 6. 1. · ·

106. Um· nimirum] ‘⁴ He bath said in his beart, 1 shall not be moved, sor
1 shall never be in adversity’' (Ps. x. 6), is very like the argument Horace

uts in his rich man’s mouth,—-the man whose fortune was large enough

Por three kingS. He argues that he is so rich that he never can be otherwise.
As to ‘nimirum,' see Ep . i. 9. l, n.

107. Uter-ne Ad casus ubios] On ‘ne,’ see S. i. 10. 21, and with ‘dubios-³

’100000 ⁴ more rofusely.' 1 am not aware that it is so used anywhere else.
³⁴ Metato ixi-age lo ’ is the farm which has been marked 0111 by the public sur-
veyor (⁴metator’), and assigned to Umbrenus (See Introduction.) This
'participle is used passively in C. ii. 15. 15. ‘ Fortem ’.has been explained in
the note on C. S. 58, and for ‘colonum,’ see C. ii. 14. 12, n. As ‘colonum-²
·signifies a tenant, ‘mercede ' (⁴ rent') is only added to give additional force
to the contr-ast. It makes rather 0 clumsy sentence. Farms were held either
on payment of rent, or of ,0 certain part of the produce of the land3 but
»‘merces ’ could not mean the latter. A ‘ colonus ' who held on the latte'r
·termS, was called ‘ partiarius? ‘ Temere ' signifies that which is done witir-
out consideration, because habitually done. ,
“ 116. luce profesta] ‘Profesti dies were working-days, as opposed to ‘festi-³

' 122. cum du ioeficm] Some take this for 0 large coarse kind of fig (qna-

with ‘culpa'·for our ‘magister-3 or ‘rex bibendi,' συμποσίαρχος” (C. 1. 4.
18, n.). It appears that they agreed between themselves as to 00100 mode of
drinking, and established a penalty for the transgression of it, which trans-
gression (‘ culpa’) was to do that which at drinking arties, where a presi-
dent was appointed, he might do arbitrarily3 that 10, 011 ier mulct 0 guest of a·

the name ‘ Sermones ' given to the Satires and Epistles.

43. 03·an sonatumm,] This form does not appear elsewhere in this
word. Cicero uses ‘ praestaturus: and Sall. (δας. 47 j ‘ juvaturus? Horace
has ‘intonata' in Epod. ii. ⁵1. See Virg. (Georg. iii. 294ss “Nunc vene-
randa Pales, magno nunc ore sonandum.’' The attributes of u poet, which
Horace considers essential, are genius, inspiration, and dignificd sentiments,
und lan suited to high subjecta ·

45. I ⁶ quamam] ‘ Iu reference to this, certain persons have raised the
question whether a eomedy was or was not a poem ' ι “ utrum comoedia esset
poema necne esset.” This is a, grammarian's question, and‘ depende upon
the definition assumed for a poem, in which, however, imagination is gen-
erally suppooed to have a conspicuous place, and this would exclude the com-
edies of Plautus and Terence, and their Greek originals of the New Comedy‚
from the title of poeti-y. But the same rule would exclude much more that
has passed for try, with less pietension to the name even than Horace’s
SiutireS, md the eautontimorumenos. ‘ Quidam ’ signifies the grammarians
o Alexan ria. · .

48. Deffm samam] ‘ Discrepare‚’'‘‹1issidere,’ ‘distaress ‘differre,' Horace
uses with the dative (see C. i. 27. 5, n.), but the two last also with the ab·
lative and ⁴ ab.' “ It must not be supposed, however, that ‘ from ' can in any

A! ραιει· ardens] Demea in the Adelphi of Terence, and Plautus’s Theu-
ropides are instances in point. ‘ At: which usually in such places introduces
an objection, here seems to be the remark of one who supposed that the fury
and ranting of the enraged father in the comedy might be supposed to par·
take of the fire of poetry. But Horace disposes of the objection very easily.
Any father who had such a son as Pomponius, for instance, a dissolute youth
(of whom we know nothing more), would probably storm at him in much the
same terms that the man on the stage uses. It was the aim of the New
Comedy‚ which the Roman writers followed, to put real life upon the stage
by means of a plot natural and probable, and. to represent men and. women
as they were seen· and heard every da , in which it differed essentially from

· the Old Comedy‚ a mere vehicle for po itical and personal satire.

So Cicero (In Verr. ii. 4. 22) s aks of “ purum argentum‚’' plate with the
omamental work t'aken off. kssesays it is not enough (to constitute a poem)
that it should be written throughout in plain lunguage‚ which, if you take to
pieces, it will be found that any father in common life expresses his wrath in

the same terms as the father in the play.

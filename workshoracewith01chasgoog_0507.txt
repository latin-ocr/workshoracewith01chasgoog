66. Ante Larem proprium] See note on Epod. ii. 66. ‘Libatis dapibus'
means that the master and his friends (‘ meique ’) dined lightly, and left the
greaterpart of the dishes to his slave& The master, in this instance, as well ,
as his slaves, dined in the ⁸ atrium,' where the images of ·the Lares were
placed. ‘ Lib'are ' is to touch lightly. · See Aen. v. 91 : “inter pateras et‘·
levia pocula serpens Libavitque dapes.'’ The distribution of the remains of
the dinner to the slaves was a matter of course.

· 69. Iaeyibus insanis,] See S. 2. 123, n. One of the strictest laws of a ban· ·

quet directed by a presiding'· symposiarch‚ would have reference to the regu-
latiori of the quantity of wine to be drunk by each guest at each round.
Horace's notion of liberty hero-is to be able to drink as much or as little as
'he pleased, which is expressedxby ‘inaequales calices? . .

70. uomit] ‘ Uvescere' does not occur elsewhere, but it corresponds with
Horacc's word ‘uvidu8,' C. ii. 19. 18, and iv. 5. 39. '
, 7 2. -Necmale necne Lepos salta,- Lepos was a ‘pantomimus ’ who was so

named from the grace with which e performed his part, as the name impliea'
The-business of the ‘mimi‚' as of the ‘ mimae‚' was to recite poetry‚ as wellas ¹
to act parts in the fai-ces that bore the same narne 1 S. i. 10. ὃ, ιι). The
word ‘ saltare’ was applied to all pantomimic aeting, and the motion of the
iimbs in dumb show, See S. i. 5. 63, where Messius calls upon Sarmentus to
act Polyphemus, ——“ Pastorem saltaret uti Cyclopa rogabat,’' where ‘ salta7
‘net ’ is equivalcnt to ‘ movetur' in “ Nunc Satyrum nunc pastorem Cyclopa.
movetur ’' (Eppa ii. 2. 125). ’

75. usus‘rectumne] Cicero makes Laelius indignantly deny the doctrine

that makes utility the foundation of friendship, and he says, with much truth
and dclicacy, “ non enim tam utilitas parta per amicum quarn amici amor
ipse delectat” (Lael. e. θήκη). There is more in the same strain in c. viii„
where he makes virtue thebaeis of friendship.
. 76. notiora boni samumque] This subject is discussed at large in Cicero’s
treatise· ‘ De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum,' and was a ‘commonplace in
Horaee's day, as it has been in all ages. ⁴ Summum ³ represents the Greek
τέλος, ‘the end p sedl‘ · ' · ’

77. Cervius] is was an old neighbor of Horace’s. There is not the
smallest elev to his history or to that of ArelliuS, who, however, must have
been a rich man and careful about his money- 0

79. Olim] ‘ Once upon a time ’z a common way of beginning a story that
does not profess to be true. . ,

- 82. attentus} This is a common word for what we should call ‘close’
See Eppz i. 7. 91; ii. 1. 172. ⁴ Ut tamen ' means ‘ita tamen ut! Compare
· 842.⁸ nec [onyae invidit avenae] This construction is Greek: φθονεῖν τινί
τινος. The Latin construction is with the accusative and dative, as S..i. 5,
493 Epp. i. 14. 41. The ‘avena’ here is the cultivated oat, and ‘longae’
describes the size cf its grain. The wild-oat Vix-gil distinguishes from this
' by the epithet ‘sterilis ⁹ (G. i. 153), and couples it with the ‘ lolium: or tare,
with which the. host on this occasion satisfied himself.

87. male] This goes with ‘tangentisj and is equivalent to ‘ vix!

· 89. Esset ador} See C. iv. 4 41, n.

93. mihi creda] 'Rhese words are parenthetical, as Ovid (Am. ii. 2. 9):
“ Si sapis, o custos, odium, mihi crede, mereri Desine.'' The lang-uage that
follows is very like that of Hercules in the Alcestis of Euripides (782,

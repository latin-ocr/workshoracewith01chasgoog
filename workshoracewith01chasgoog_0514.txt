10. His ubi sublatis] The narrator is inclined to make a short business of
the viands, but he is brought back to them afterwards, The meat bein re-
moved, (and though he only mentions one course here, we may gather {rom
what eomes presently that there was no lack of dishes, and therefore, proba-
bly, there were the usual-courses,) a slave, with his clothes well tucked up,
‘succinctus' (see S. 6. 107, n.)‚ came and wiped the table with a handsome
purple towel, and another gathered up whatever had fallen or had been thrown
on the floor,'which at the same time he strewed with saw-duat, perhaps scent-
ed (see S. ii. 4. 81). ‘ Gausape‚ -is ' (other forms of which are ‘gausapa,'

13. ut Attica vimon When the litter is cleared away and the table wiped,
two slaves, one from the East and named after0his native river, the other a
Greek, walk in with two amphorae, one of Caecuban, the other of Chian wine.
They are represented as coming in in a solemn and stately manner, like the

ported from the Greek isles. Whether Horace refers to this practice, and
means that the wine had not been -pre ared, and was of inferior quality, or

whether he means that this pretende Chian had in fact never crossed the .

seas, but had been concor-ted at home, is doubted. Orelli and most of the
commentators adopt the first opinion, after the Scholiasts. 1 am more in·
clined to the latter. Compare Persius (vi. 39) :
- “ Postquam sapere urbi
Cum pipere et palmis venit nostrum hoc maris expers,'’
where he means a learning brcd not in Grceee, but at home.

18. Divitias miseras l] This exclamation is drawn from Horace by his
friend's description. It was money that had brought the man out of his
proper obscurity, and caused him all the petty shifts and anxieties that wait

20. Summus eqo The company consisted, as was usual, of nine persons,
who reclined on ree couches, These were arranged so as to form three
sides of a square, with the table in the middle, the fourth end being open,
as shown in the accompanying diagram. ,

On each coueh were three persona. On the ‘ summus,' Fundanius says he
himself, ViscuS‚ and Varius reclined. On the ‘ medius lectus ¹ were Maecenas
Α and the two uninvited friends he brought wit-h him, Servilius Balatro, and
Vibidius. On the middle seat of the ‘imus lectus’· lay Nasidienus, above
him Nomentanus, who acted as nomenclator (see Epp. 1. 6. 50, ιι),ι and be-
low him Porcius, another of his parasioes. The place of honor was the cor-
ner-seat of the ‘medius lectus) aad next to that, on the first seat of the
‘imus,' was usually the place of the host. But it appears that Nasidienus

places were usually occupied by dependents of the host (parasites), who filled
up‘the table, and helped to (latter the host and entertain the company. This
explains Epp. i. 18. 10, “imi Derisor lecti.'' Sometimes these places were
occupied by ‘ umhrae‚' brought by the invited guests. By ‘ summus ego '

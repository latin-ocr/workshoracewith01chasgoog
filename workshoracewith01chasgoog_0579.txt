tationS, cannot open his lips when he gets to Rome, and is only laughed at
by the people for his sobriety. This is an odd defence -for one who had
written so much as he had done at Rome. It is meant for. a joke. ‘ Septem
annis ’ is not to be taken literally, as if Horace had been seven years at
'Athena which is very improhahle‚ bnt for any considerable number. He

and it does not matter. One was a jurisconsultus (see S. i. 1. 9, n.), and the
other a teacher of rhetoric. The lawyer said the rhetorician was a perfect
Gracchus for eloquence, and he returned the compliment by declaring that
his brother was a second Scaevola for leg-al learning. And this sort of mu-
tual fiattery goes on, Horace save, among poete, and he cannot keep pace
with their passion forpraise. Tiberius Gracchus and his brother Caius were

⁶ toth, in Cicero's opinion, great oratore. We need not therefore attempt to

decide which⁴ Horace means ns to understand here. Q. Mucius Scaevola the
augur, son-in-lawof C. Laelius, and an early instructor of Cicero (Lael. c. 1 ),
was learned in the⁴ law3 but his namesake and younger contemporary, the
Pontifex Maximus (mentioned in the same treatise>‚ was more celebrated
still.. This name, therefore, like that of Gracchus for oratory, stands for a

means melodum-⁶³, and is a sort of mock compliment.

93. quanto mimine] This expresses the pompons strut with which they
pass the 11er of Apoll0‚ in which they take it for granted a place is re-
served for them. As to ‘aedem‚' see S. i. 10. 38.

95. proed] This word significes an distance, great or small. Here it

means hard by, as in S. ii. 6. 1053 pp. i. 7. ‘Quid ferat' means what

’ 97. Οαοᾱίτηέν d totidem phqis] They carry on such a contest of mutual
flattery, that they are like two gladiatorS, each trying to get the better of tho
other. ‘ Samnites ’ were a particular class of gladiators‚ so called because
they wore the same anns as that people, particularly an oblong shield. See
S. ii. 6. 44, n. ‘Ad lumina prima' would be usually till the second course,
when the lights were brought in. Among theamusements that rich men had

took place, there were certain persons called ‘custodes ' appointed to take

process votes came to be called ‘ puncta!- See A. P. 343, n·

101. Fit Mimnermus] See Epp. i. 6. 65, n. Horace seems to, think him
superior to CallimachuS, who was a grammarian and voluminous pro
writer as well as a poet, a native of Cyrene, and established at Alexand

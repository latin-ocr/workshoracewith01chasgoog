dms has imitated (iv. 22) of the mountain iu iabor, are fonnded: ὤδινεν
οὖρος, ,εἶτα μῦν effingam, whieh in Athenaeus (xiv. 6) is quoted a little dif-

, ferently: ,ὤδινεν ὅ ς, Ζεὺς δ’ ε’ aflei-ro, re δ’ ἔτεκεν μῦν. Α

141: Dic milei, lusu, virum] shis is a version of the opening verses of the

. Odyssey. Compare Epp. 1. 2. 19, sq,

· 143. Aba-simmaa ex hlywe] Horace says of Homer, that he does not begin
with a flash which en s in smoke, but with him out of smoke eomes a bright
light3 that is, out of a modest beginninsr the moder is led on to beauties and

' 'objeets of interest; and he is carried raph-ily forward, instead of being detained
over matters preliminary and irrelevant. It is obvious that ‘fumo' in tho

· second clause is out of laec, and is only used to maintain a. verba-l antith-
esis ; and the beauties se ected (ἦ speciosa miracula.ss ‘striking marvels ') aro
not the most strikino. “ ’

 

. 145. Antiphaten Scyllamque] These are all stories from the od ssey.

, Antiphates was king of the Laestrygones, a gigantie raee in Sicily, w 10 de'-

voured three of the companions of Ulysscs, and destroyed his ships (x. 80,

sqq.). The adventure with Polyphemus, the Cyclops, forms the leading

event of the ninth book. The description of Scylla and charybdis is con-

tained in the twelfth book (vv. 85, sqq.). ²
146. Nec redicam Diomedis] This was related in a Cyelie poem called

· Νόστρι. Meleager, who was one of the Argonauta andwas still more famous

· for the destruction of the boar sent b Diana to vex. the inhabitants of Caly-
don iu AEtolia, was uncle to Diome , being bnother to Tydeus, The causo

of his death is variously related. According to Homer, he' was eut-sed by his

mother, Althaea, for the slaughter of her two brothers (ΙΙ. ix. 567, sqq-l, and.

. her Erinnys pursued him to his death. But as this was before the Trojun

. war, and had nothing to do with it, to begin an account of Diomed’s retum
with an account os his nucleis death would be absurd enough. lt would
seem as if some poet had been guilty of this absurdity.

, 147. yemino-ab ovo,·J Thut is, from the birth of Helen, who was bom
from one of the eggs brought forth by Leda, while Castor aud Pollux issned
from the other. (See S. ii. 1. 26, “ovo prognatus eodcm.’') This introduc.
tory matter was handled in the poem Κύπρια of StasinuS, >a. Cyelie poet, of

. which the following fragment has been preserved: ”

Δ

τοῖς δὲ μετὰ τριτάτην ’,Ελένῃν τέκε, θαῦμα βροτοῖσι, “
τήν ωὌΨεΑ καλλίκομξος Ιῖἷέμεσιε φιλότητι μιγσῖσζα
Ζηνί, θεων βασιληι, reeca κρατερῆς ὑπ’ Amyntas.

“ 148. in nwde‘cm res] The ancients appear particularly to have remarked
.. this quality of Homer’s poems. See Quintil. vii. ³10. ·1.1 ε “ uhi ‚ab initiis in-
cipiendum, ubi more >Homerico e mediis vel ultimis? '’
151. Aeque-ita mentitur, sic ver-125] “‘Itaf ‘so,’ (the oldest form of the df
. neuter pronoun ‘id,') differs from ‘ sie,' ‘soff as the logical ‘ l‘' or ‘ eo,>' ¹ this,’
differs from the demonstrative ‘'ho‚' ‘this.' ²³ ‘Ita,’ therefore, is the usual
word with ‘ut' following. But the poets (and sometimes even the prose-
w1·iters> use ‘sie' in the same construction, and in others in which ‘ita’ is

 

 

more usual. Compare C. i. 8. l, ‘⁸ Sic te Diva potens Cypri-'² ς and Epp. i. l
7. 69, “ Sic ignovisse putato.''
154. aulaea mamutii] See Epp.·ii. l. 189. In -the next verse ‘eante' is
used for the actor. lieero uses *it iu the sanie sense. (See Eos-collini.)
‘ Vos plaudite ' were the words with which a play usually concluded.
157. Mobilibusque decor naturis] Horace means that men's characters shift
:and change with the different stages of life, and that these changes must be
attended to. He goes on to explain them in a clear and eleg-ant manner.
ο 161, custode remoto] This means the ‘ ›aedagogus,’ as in S. i. 6.-81, where
see note. This person’s functions cease when the boy assumed the ‘toga
virilis? ⁴ Campi,’ as elsewhere, means the Campus Martius.¹ Ι

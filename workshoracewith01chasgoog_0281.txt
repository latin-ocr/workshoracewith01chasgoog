sll, 12. Pontica pinus] The best shi timber came from Pontus. ‘ Pi-
ngsl' is in apposition with the subject oiP‘Jactesss and ‘nobilis ² agrees with
⁸ i vae.

15. nisi—Debes ludibrium] i. e. ‘if thou be not fated to destruction?

17. Nuper sollicitum] κ Taking the Ode as an address to the state, we can
only understand Horace to mean, that while h'e was attached to BrutuS, or
before he had received pai-don, he had no other feelin s than sear for his
own safety and disgust with the state of the country; ut nOW, under Au-
gustuS‚ he watches its fate with the affection and anxiety of a friend. The
order is, ‘ (Tu) quae nuper eras mihi sollicitum taedium (et quae) Nunc (es) .
desiderium curaque non levis, Vites aequora Interfusa (inter) nitentes Cy·
dadas! “ .

19. nitentes] This is like ‘fulgentes' (C. iii. 28.14), shining, as ·cliffs
will do in the sun. The Cyclades abeund in white marble.

'l'ms is probably an early composition of Horace, made up of materials⁶
from the Greek, and written merely to exercise his pen.

Arteman-nr. —Paris is carrying off Helen, when Nereus causes a calm,
and thus prophesies their fate ·. ‘⁴ With dark omen art thou carrying home
her whom Greece hath swern to recover. Aias for the sweating horse and
rider, and the deaths thou art bringing upon Troy! Pallas prepareth her
anns and her fury. Under Venus’s shelter‚ comb thy locks and strike thy
lyre, and hide thyself in thy chamber3 but it shall not avail thee. Seest thou
not Laertes’s son, Nestor of P rlos, Teucer 'of SalamiS, and Sthenelus the
fighter and bold charioteer ’ἓ erion too, and the son of TydeuS, from
whom thou shalt fiee pantin ‚ as the stag flecth from the wolfi—thou, who
didst boast better things to t y fair one ’ἒ Achilles’s wrath mav put off the
evil day, but the fire of the Greek shall consume the homes of Troy.

2. Helenen} Horace uses the Greek inflections in his odes, and the Latin
in his iambic verses, satit-es, and epistles (Bentley). This might be expect·
ed, especially when, as in this instance, the imitation of Greek writers is
obvious.

5. Nereus] He is made to speak, because the sea-gods were endowed with
the ist of prffhccy. ‘Mala avi ' is like “alite lugubri,'’ C. iii. 3. 61;
“ ma a alite, ’ pod. x. 1.

7 . conjurata - rumpere] This is'a legitimare prose construction. “ Con·
juravere patriam incendere ’' (Sal. Cat. 52. 24. See Liv. 22. 38). ‘ Rum-
pere ' governs ‘ regnum ’- as well as ‘ nuptiaS,’ though forits sense it ought
only to belong to ‘ nuptias)

1 1. αεῃίᾰαὲθ The ‘ aegis ² was properly the skin of the goat Amalthea,
the nurse of us, which he used as a shicld or as a breastplate (see C. iii.
4. 57), where it is worn, as. here, by Pallas. The word is not confined in
use to the original meaning, but is taken for a metal shield or breastplate
worn bv Zeus Pallae, or Apollo. It had a· 'Gorgon’s head upon it.

13. VeneriJ'Jn-aesidio] See Hom. 11. iii. 44, and on v. 16 see 11. iii. 380 ;
vi. 321. Horace's description of Paris is drawn, not from Homer, who
makes him brave, but from later writers who altered the Homerie characters.
See Ile *ne, Exc. i. Aen. ii. See also Aen. iv. 215, sqq.

‚ 14.- ecies caesam'emJ· See C. iv. 9. 13.

15. divides ς] ‘ Dividere carmina' is perhaps to sing and play alternately.

4. invidia major] Horace was not too good to be maligned, but he could
rise above it, which is the meaning of ‘ major,’ κρείσσων. His birth drew
contempt upon him while he held a command in Brutus’s anny, and aster·
wards when he became intimate with Maecenas (see Sat. i. 6. 46, sqq.) ; but
those who envied tried as usual to make use of him (see Sat. ii. 6. 47, sqq.).

melagm areae calmi-tis] The Marsi were one of the hat-diest of the Italian ⁹
tribes, and supplied the best foot-soldiers for the Roman army, which is hence
called ‘ Marsa cohors ’ (see C. iii. 5. 9).

Dacus — Geloni,] See C. i. 19. 10, n. The Daci were not finally subdued

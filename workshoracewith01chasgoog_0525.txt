23. Sirenum voces How by the directions of Circe Ulysses eluded the
charming voice of t ve SirenS, is related in the twelfth book os the Odyssey,
165,·sqq.; and the way in which Circe poisoned his companions and changed
them into swine‚ will befound in the tenth book, 230, sqq. The Sirens were

dramatists. It means a mere undist-inguished heap, and ‘fruges consumere
’nati’ is au adaptation of Homer's οἳ ἀρούρης καρπὸν ἔδουσι (Il. vi. 142).
Ι Nos ’ means the common sort of men, ‚among whom Horace places himself, ·
and all but the sage, who is like UlysseS, while the rest are no better than his
wife’s suitors, gluttons‚ wine-drinkerS‚ and lazy; οἱ· the subjects of Alcinous,
king of Phaeacia or Scheria (an island of which, if it had any existence, the
position is unknown), the host of Ulysses, to whom he relates his adventures
(Odyss. lib. ix. sqq). The king describes his people thus: · ’

αἰεὶ ὃ ἡμῖν δαίς τε φίλη, κί’θαρῖς πε, χοροί τε,
’ εἵματά τέ’ ἐξημοιβὰ, λοετρά τε θερμὰ, καὶ εὐναί.
(Odyss. viii. 248.) ¹
The Phaeacians were proverbial in respect to good living. See Epp. i. 15.
24. On ‘cute euranda‚’ see S. ii. 5. 38, u.

31. cessatum ducere curam] ‘ Duco,' as a verb of motion, takes the accusa-
tive of the verbal substantive to denote the object, just as ‘venio ' and ‘ mitto ',
do. “ The accusative of the verbal in ‘ tu ’ is often called the supine active, ⁸
and the ablative of the same the supine passive3 but there is nothing passive
in the latter, and therefore the distinction is inappropriate.'' ‘Facta ' is ‘in
the doinorss as‘ factum ' is ‘to the doing' ; so neither is passive. ί ·

32. U't'. jugulent homines] From the above examples of virtue, especially
Ulysses, Horace urges-his friend to the pursuit of it, and asks whether, if the
robber can rise before daylight to take away other men's lives, he will not.
wake u to save his own (32-43). 4·

34. ἰ noles sanus curre-⁴1> hydropicus ,·] It appears that active exereise was
recommended by the ancient physicians for dropsical patients, Horace
meane, that, if he will not learn wisdom 'while he is unharmed by the world,
he will have to do so when it has spoilt him. ς

39. in annum 5³] .So he says below (Epp. 11. 23), “neu dulcia differjn
annum.” It is the habit of procrastinatorsto put off the work of to-day till
to-morrOW‚ of this week till next week‚ of this year till next year, and this is
Horace's meaning. ‘ In annum ' is till next year. ‘ Dimidium facti qui
coepit habet ’ isan adaptation of the Greek saying ἀρχὴ δέ τοι ἥμισυ παν·
τός, attributed variously to Hesiod aud Pythagoras. l

44. Quaeritur amentum] This is advauced as a reason why men put off
the dayhof reformatiou‚ that they are anxious to make themselves eo'mfortable
and ric 44-54 . ε

47. No(n domu-3 et fundum] See S. ii. 5. 108, n. ‘Deduxit,' in the next
line, is used like the aorist. .

52. fhmenta podaqram‚] As to ‘ fomenta ' in a derived sense, see Epod. xi.
17, n. Horace means to say, that fomentations go a small way towards eur-
ing the gout. Perhaps he means that they aggravato the pain. ὁ

55. Sperne voluptatem This is part of the same subject. -The pursuit of
sensual pleasure is connected with the pursuit of money, which is wanted for
it. The pursuit of money leads on to envy, aud envy to wrath, so. that all
these pithy sayings hang together. ·

58. Invidia Siculi] Horace probably alludes to the bull of Phalari8‚ ty·
rant of Agrigentum in Sicily. It. was made of bronze. Persons were put
inside, and the metal was gradually heated till they were roasted to death.
But the tyrants of Sicily were proverbial.

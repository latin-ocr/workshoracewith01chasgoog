great simplicit and beauty in this Ode. whether it is original, or a free copy

· from the Gree ‚ cannot be determined.

Auentini-tr. — Weep not, Asterie; Gyges is faithful, and will return with
the spring, a rich man. He has been driven to Oricum, and is weeping with
impatienee for thee. Chloe, his hosteSS, is trying to seduce him, and fright-
ens him with stories of rejected wompn's revenge. But 116 is deaf to her se-
' ductions. Bewane in thy turn of EnipeuS, thy gallant neighbor. shut thy

deors and listen not to his songs.

2. Favonii] See C. i. 4. 1. FavoniuS, according to· Pliny (ii. 47), blew ,

‘ ab occasu aequinoctiali,’ that is, due west. It would therefore be a favorable
wind for a vessel coming down the Adriatic, and not very unfavorable for
sailing up the west coast of Italy. It would be in her teeth as she tried to
make the Straits of Messina. But Horace's winda are not more studied than
his places and persons The lover is waiting till the weather changes and
the winds are mild and favorable. The Favonii are called ‘eandidi,’ as No-
tus and Iapyx are each called ‘ albus ' (C. i. 7. 15g iii. 27. 19).
3. Thyna merce] The Thyni and Bithyni were origine ly two different
eoples of Thrace, who migrated into Asia Minor and displaccd the nativeS.
{¹01- some time they continued separate, but when Horace wrote, the distine-
tion was net observed‚ and ‘ Thyna merx ' was Bithynian merchandise (Epp.
i. 6. 33). Bithynia, after it became a Roman province, included a great part
of PontuS, and so comprised nearlly the whole sca-coast of Asia Minor, and
all the trade along that coast woul come under the title of ‘ Thyna merx.’
4. fide,] - The genitive. The older forms of genitives of this deciension

were four, ‘es,' ‘ei,’ ‘1,' and ‘e.'

5 Oricum This was a town in Epirus, situated at the top of the bay .

formed by t e Acroceraunian promontory. See Aen. x. 136: “Oricia tere·
bintho.'' The constellation of the goat Amalthea (Capra) rises at the begin-

ning of October.

·11. Dicens ignibus ιινί,] ‘Ignibus ' is used as ovid uses it (Am. iii. 9. 56), “

“vixisti dum tuus ignis eram.’' We may understand C. i. 27. 16, “Non
erubescendis adurit Ignibu5,” in the same way, i. e. the flame put for the per-

son who cau‘ses it.
θ12. Tentat molle vafer modia] On ‘tentatss see note on C. iii. 4. 71.

13. mulier pevfida Antea or Sthenobaea‚ wife of Pmetus, king of Arg-08, ι
fell in love with Bel erophonteS‚ and when he rejected her proposals‚ she ae· ἑ

ὀαεθᾱ him to her husband, as Potiphar's wife accused Joseph.

14. Falsis impzderz‘t] ‘ Im ello ' is used with the infinitivo meod by Taci· Ῑ

out of revenge for is rejectien 'of her, indueed her husband to expose Peleus ·

to destruction by wild beasts on Mount Pelion, where he took him to hunt,
and left him asleep without his swerd. Hippolyte is called ‘Magnessam’

20. 'Fallax ⁴historiasmovet] ‘ Mentionem movere ’ occurs, in Livy ; ‘ cantus ⁸

movere ' in Virgi13 ‘ carmen movere ’ in Ovid. ‘ Historias movere ’ is there-
fore a legitimate expression3 ‘ brings up,' ‘ calls to his mind.'

21. Frustra s] A complete and very comprehensive sentence. It occurs ·

below (C. 13. 6). Some persons join the word on witin the last line, which
weakens its force. Icari is the Icarium Mare, that part of the AEgean which

washes the coast of Caria. With these words compare Euripides (Med. 28), .

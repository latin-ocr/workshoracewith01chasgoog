The work was ‘andei-taken at the suggestion of Paos. Wotcorr GmsS,
of Harvard University‚ and was executed under his immediate personal
super-vision. In reference to it he says :—

⁶⁴ During the preparation ot Mr. Sharples’s work Ι have had repeated opportunius·
to ohserve the care and labor bestowed upon it. ,All the tables have been thoroughly
raised. and the ponor-ehem repeatedly read. Whenever it was possible, the tables
have been checked by differencing. Of course it is impossible that such a work
should be free from errors, but 1 believe that but few will be detected. Upon the
whole, 1 think that a work soconscientiously executed aud so extensive will be found
ot real valae to· the working chemist.”

From ms. Β. staina, 'Yaze eouege.

‘⁸ 1 have examined with much satisfaction the copy ot* Sharpies’s ‘ Chemlcal ma-
bles‚’ you were so gooi as ω στοά me. The work evinces care and discrimination in
the selection and arrangement os the maten-lais which cover a much wider range of
topice than can be found in any other manual with which 1 am familiar. This is
especially true in those nepai-ments os chemical Physics. in which such rapid ⁸
progress has been macie within a few years past, as to render Mr. Sharples‘s book. a
most aceeptable addition ω the libra-s and laboratory οἰ every chemist, whether he

. be temnet or pupil.”

‘⁴ 1 have careiully examined the work, and am free to say that I consider it one or
great value to the chemical student. Aside from new matter, it contains a large
amount of material usually distributed through a great number of works, and fre-

“ Ι have examine-d, with pleasure, the very extensive ond valuable collection of
chemical and Physica} Tables which you have lately publisbed.

“Their use will save the time and trouble that are now expended in hunting down
the information contained in them through many volumen. “

“ '1⁸0 the work itseir (chemical Tables, by S. P. Sharnles) I am glad to be able to
give my hem-ty commendatior». The idea was a capital one ot· thus bringing together,
in a small hand book, these tames, which are of great value to the chemist‚ and
which were scattered through many works, and not conveniently accessible to most,
and not at all accessible to some. The work ‚inst meetsa want of my own. Ι shall
. keep it always within easy reach on my table, and shall introduce its use in my
classes. 1 am confident that in whatever way 1 may busy myselt' with mernisti-y,
whether as a student οι· a practical chemist or a teacher ot the science, 1 shall find
the work in question an exceedingly usei'ul one.”

From Prof. G. J. Brush, Yale Collega.-

“ Ι have examined the chemical Tables with considerable care, and Ι consider the
book the most complete collection of the kind that Ι am acquainoed with, and Mr.
snm-ples has done a good service ln thus bringing together so much valuable matter.
The book shows carefui editing‚ and will be invaiuable to every working laborator-y.

‘⁴ Ι beg leave to thank you tor Mr. Sharples's Chem‘ical Tables, and take piensure
in saying that 1 think them a very valuanle collection, and' sinui take great pleasure
iu recommending them to my own students working in the laboratory. N υ practical

chemist should be without them ” ,

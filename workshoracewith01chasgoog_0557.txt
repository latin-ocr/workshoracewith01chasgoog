19. Sem-mr 090· ἰρεε-ᾳῦιίᾹ This· verb does not occur elsewhere. The par·
ticiple is used in the next Epistle (v. 2). Aristippus is supposed to pari-y
the blow (‘ eludere‚' a metaphor taken from-the gladiators) of Diogenes by
admstfing, for the sake of arguurpnt, that he acted parasite to a king; yet it
was for his own advantage ; whereas the Cynic acted parasite to the popu,-
lace for their amusement; he begged their dirt provisione, and gave them

. 21. Officiumfltcio s] ‘ Officium ⁸ is commonly applied to attendance on
great people; and the most servile are wont to say they are only ‘ doing their
duty ’ by their betters. As to ⁴ vilia ‚rerum,’ see C. iv. 12. 19, n.; S. ii.

23. Omnis Aristippum decuit color] See Epp. i. 1. 18, n. ‘ Color’ is ‘ color
vitae’ (S. ii. 1. 60), and corresponds to ‘vitae via' below (v. 26). We use
⁴ complexion' in the same double sense. Horace means that, while Aristip-
puspaid court to the rich, he could do without them, if necessary. ‘ On the
other hand,’ he says, ‘ he who, >on the principle of endurancc, puts on his
double cloak, Ι should be surprised if a change of life would suit him ’ 5 that
iS, he is more the cre ro of habit than the man he condemns

25. duplici panno} he asceticistn of Diogenes was his way of carrying
out the principle of endurance, which was a chief feature in his teacher's sys-

tem. A βοήθει’ abolla‚' a garment thrown loosely over the person, served '

him for his dreSS, without tunic. He is said to have been the first to wear it
double and to have slept in it, and those who followed him, adopting the

Szoics differed from the Cynics only in the use of the tunic (S. xiii. 121).

36. Non cuivis homini] Οὔ παντὸς ἀνδρὸς εἷς Κόρινθον ἔσθ’ ὁ πλοῦςζ
There am various explanations given of this proverb, but none can safely
be relied upon. ‘ To go to Corinth’ involved a difficulty in some sense or

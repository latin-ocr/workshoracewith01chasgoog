, without also making many enemieS. His Satires are full of allu-

sions to the enmity his verses had raised up for him on all hands.
He became acquainted, among other literary persone, with virgil
and VariuS, wh0‚ about three years after his return (Β. c. 39),
introduced him to MaecenaS, who was careful of receiving into his
circle a tribune of BrutuS, and one whose writings were of a kind
that was new and unpopular. He accordingly saw nothing (ff
Horace for nine months after his introduction to him. He then
sent for him (Β. c. 38), and from that time continued to be his
patron and warmest friend.

At his house, probably, Horace became intimate with Pollio,
and the many persons of consideration whose friendship he ap—
pears to have enjoyed. Through MaecenaS, also, it is probable
Horaoe was introduced to Augustus; but when that happened 1s
uncertain. In Β. c. 37, Maecenas was deputed by Augustus to
meet Μ. Antonius at Brundisium, and he took Horace with him
on that journey, of which a detailed account is given in the fifth
Satire of the first book. Horace appears to have parted from the
rest of the company at Brundisium, and perhaps returned to
Rome by Tarentum and Venusia. (See S. i. 5, Introduction.)
Between this journey and Β. ὀ. 32, Horace received from his j

friend the present of a small estate in the valley of the Digentia ‘

(Licenza), situated about thirty-four miles from Rome, and four-
teen from Tibur, in the Sabine country. Of this property he
gives a description in his Epistle to Quintius (i. 16), and he
appears to have lived there a part of every year, and to have
been fond of the place, which was very quiet and retired, being
four miles from the nearest town, Varia (Vico Varo), a muni-
cipium perhapS, but not a place of any importance. During this
interval he continued to write Satires and EpodeS, but also, it ap-
pears probable, some of the odes, which some years later he
published, and others which he did not publish. These composi-
tione, no doubt, were seen by his friends, and were pretty well
known before any of them were collected for publication. The

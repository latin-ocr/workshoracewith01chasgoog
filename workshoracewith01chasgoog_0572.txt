mina,’- as is generally supposed from the town Fescennia or Fescennium,
belonging to the Falisci. From these verses others took their name, which
wene more licentious and scurrilous, and satires got the same name, but the
sort of poetry with which it originated was harmleSS‚ as Horace says. Com-
pare virgil, Georg. ii. 385, sqq.

152. quin etiam lex Poenaque lata] See S. ii. 1. 80, ιι. ‘Lata' properly
belongs to ‘lex.' When a penalty was inserted in the ‘ lex,' it was ‘lex
sancta,’ as stated in the note just referred to.

154. Describid, This is used in the same sense in S.i. 4. 3: “Si quis ⁷
erat dignus describi.” ‘Fustuarium' was a mode of putting to death by
beating with sticks and stoning‚ usuall , but not only,⁸ as the passage shoWS,
inflicted on soldiers. (See Dict. Antt. ,

156. Graecia capta ferum pictorem cepit} The taking of Syracuse by Mar-
celluS, B. c. 212, the seventh year of' the second Punic war, led to the intm-

time first made known to the Romana In B. c. 146, the last year of the
third Punic war, Corinth was taken by Mummius„ and Southern Greece was
formed into the Roman province of Achaia. ι Horace had probably both'
these periods in his mind, as well as the conquestos Southern Italy, in the
towns of which were some of the finest works of Grecian art. The first play
copied from the Greek was not exhibited at Rome till after the first Punic
war, which ended in B. c. 241. It was by LiviuS. See v. 62, n.

158. Defluxit numerus Saturnius] T he Saturnian verse, according'to Nie-
buhr (i. 259, n.), continued in use till about B. c. 100. Horace says traces
of the old rudeness remained in his day, probably in the less polished
‘ mimes,’ and in the ‘ Fescennina carmina, which were not extinct.

163. Quid Sophocles et Thespis et Aeschylus] Thespis is here introduced as ’
being the reputed founder of Greek tragedy. It is doubtful whether any of
his plays were translated by or known to the Roman tragediam, of whom
Horace has mentioned Livius, Ennius, NaeviuS, Pacuvius, and Accius. We
know of no others earlier than Accius, the last of these; and the number of
tragedias by these writers, the titles of which have been preserved, is one
hundred and nineteen. As to Thespis, see A. P. 27 5, n.

167. metuitque lituram] .‘But ignorantly thinks an erasure discreditable,
and shuns it.’ That is, they were bold enough in their style, and had the

. spirit of· tragedy in them, but they did not look sufficiently to the correction

and polishing of their languag03 they admitted words which were out of
taste‚ and thought too much care in composition beneath them. This is
pretty much what he says of Lucilius (S. i. 10. 56,“ε(]<;.). “

168. arcessit] See Epp. i. 5. 6, n. ‘Ex medio’ is from common life.
Horace says comedy is supposed to be very easy, because the matter is com·
mom but, in fact, it gives more trouble in proportion to the readiness fflth
which it is criticised and faults are detected and condemned. The following
remarks on the stage grew out-of the allusion to the Greek writers, but they
·are not closely connected with what is passed. They are introduced for the

170. Plautus]p It appears that Horace had no great opinion of Plautus,
all whose greatneSS, he sa S, lay in the drawing of small parts. Niebuhr
judges otherwise: he calls im one· of the greatest oetical geniuses of an-
tiquity. The language of Plautus would be roug to the ears of Horace,
and his jokes and allusions, drawn principall y from the lower ordei-S, or taken.

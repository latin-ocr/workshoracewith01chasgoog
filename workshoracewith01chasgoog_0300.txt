ODE XXXV.

ant Augustus was meditating an expedition against the Britons, and
another for the Basta, Horace commended him to the care of Fortune the Pre-
server, te whom this Ode is addressetl. The design of invading Britain was
interruptcd by an insurrection of the SalassianS‚ an Alpine people. The god-
dess Fortuna, under different characters, had many temples at Rome; but her
worship was most solemnly maintained, when Horace wrote, at Praeneste and
at Antium, where she had an erade, and was worshipped under a double
form, aa ‘ proepera ' and ‘adversa.' Tacitus mentions a temple belonging
to an Equestris Fortuna, in which the Equites set up -a statue they had vowed
for the recovery of Augusta (Ann. iii. 71). She was represented on Roman
coins with a double shi ’s rudder in one hand and a cornucopiae in the other,
which may furnish a c ew to the allusione in the second stanza. There are
piassages which may have been drawn fnom paintings in the temple at An-

ODE Ι.

Tms Ode is addressed to C. Asinius Pollio, the friend and companion in
arms of Julius Caesar. In Β. c. 40 he was consul, and in the following year
he was sent by M. Antonius aga-inst the Parthini, a tribe of Illyricum, and
having defeated and subdued them he was allowed a triumph on his return
to Rome. He then betook himself to literature, and ractising as an orator
in the courts of justice, and speaking in the senate. Ele patronized liter-ary
men, built a library, wrote poetry, particularly tragedies, and composed a
history of the civil wars, in most of which he had taken an active part. The
Ode was written after hearing Pollio recite part of this work, a practice
which he is said to have been the first to introduce among literary men at
Rome. . · .

Ιιειινξ the trag-ic Muse for a little while, and thou shalt return to her when
thou hast finished the historian's task, O Pollio! advocate, senator, con-
queror! Even now Ι seem to hear the trumpct and the clar-ion, the flash·
ing of armS, and the voices of chiefS, and the whole world subdued but the
stubborn heart of Cato. The gods of Africa have offered his victors' grand-
sons on the tomb of J ugurtha. What land, what waters, are not stained

1. Motum ex Metello confile] The foundation of the civil wars is herc laid
in the formation of the (so-called) triumvirate by Caesar, Pompeius, and
Crassus, which took place in the consulship of Q. Caecilius Metellus Celer,
and L. Afranius, A. u. c. 694, Β. c. 60. But though this was the first great
act of aggression on the liberties of Rome, the civil war did not break out
till the year A. n. c. 704, Β. c. 50, when Caesar and Pompeius came to their
final rupture. Pollio's work was in seventcen boola, and probably ended
with the battle of Actium.

2. modos] The ‘ plans ' pursued by the opposing parties.

4. Principum amicitiani&1 The allianee of Caesar and PompeiuS, and the
subsequent coalition of . Antonius and AugustuS, more than once broken
and renewed, and always maintained at the expense of the people’s liberties,
and therefore calleci ‘ graves,' ‘ o pressive,' are here principally referred to.
See Plutarch, Vit. Caes. c. 13. ollio was himself the means of reconciling
Antonius and AugustuS, in the year of his consulship Β. c. 40.

5. Nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus,] See C. i. 2, Introduction. The esth
verse of that Ode, “ Cui dabit partes scelus expiandi,’' compared with this,
makes it probable the two were written about the same time. The plural

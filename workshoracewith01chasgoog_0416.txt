verba' was conventionally applied to any oath of allegiance, and the poet
says Neaera swore by the· gods eternal devotion to his will. Elsewhere Hor-
ace exprc'sses by these words the blind ad¹ .1erence to a particular tem-‚her
declaring that he is “Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri'' (Epp. i.

and Neaem' s vow is one of eternal fidelity. Other allusions to Apollo’ s hair
will be found in C. i. ’21. 2, “Intonsum pueri dicite Cynthium’' 3C. iii. 4.

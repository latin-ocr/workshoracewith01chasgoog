stoeets (see S. i. 10. ⁷5, n.). His writings came very soon to take their place
with Homer and Virgil in. all the schools. See Juvenal (vii. 226) ε
“ Quot stabant pueri, cum totus decolor esset
FlaccuS, et haereret nigro fuligo Maroni.”

19. Cum tibi sol tepidus] In the heat of the day, and before dinner in the -
bathS, people read to themselves or one another. It is not easy to see the
connection of this line with what goes before. It is something of a contra-
diction. , But he supposes the book may perhaps be popular for a time.

20. Me, libertino natum patre] Compare S. i. 6. 6, 46, 47.

23. Me primis [1νόίέ This he considers no small praise. See Epp. i. 1⁷.
35, and S. ii. l. 75. e does not mind at this time referring to his old gen-
erals, Brutus and Cassius. The description he gives of himself corresponds
with that we tind in his biographer. See also C. ii. 11. 15. Epp. i. 4. 15.

24. solibus aptum‚] This means that he liked warm westher. See S. ii. 3.

28. Golquam Lepidum] Horace was born on the 8th of December, B. c. 65,
in the year of the consulship of L. Manlius Torquatus and L: Aurelius Cotta. ·
He completed his forty-fourth year, therefore, in December, B. c. 21. In that
year M. Lollius (to whom C. iv. 9 is addressed) and Q. AEmilius Le11idus
were consuls. ‘ Duxit' merely means that he had Lepidus for his colleague.
Why Horace should bc so particular in letting the worldoknow his present
age in the above year I cannot tell. He was in a communicative mood
when he wrote, and tells us in a few words a good deal about himself.

EPISTLE 1.

Axona other anecdotes connected with Angustus, SuetoniuS, in his Life of
Horace, says that he complained, after reading the Epistles, that he had not
{ritten one to him, whereupon Horace wrote the following Epistle to the .

m ror.

he parts of the Epistle do not hang together very closely, especially after
the first ninety lines.· They consist of compliments to Augustus; a remon-
strance about the pati-onage bestowed on the old poets 3 a description of the
rapid gmwth of art in Gneece after the Persian⁴war3 a complaint that every-
body at Rome has taken to writing νει-388, whether 'they cau or no; a com-
mendation of ets as good and useful citizens and contributors to the na-
tional piety ; a istory. of the growth of poetry in Italy; a comparison between
tragedy and comedy3 an account of the troubles of dramatic authors through
the capriees and bad taste of their audiences, which at that time is stated to
have been especially depraved; an appeal to Augustus on behalf of the poets
of the day3 and a reproof to such poets as are unreasonable or officious‚ and
attempt themes too exalted for them. '

There is much polish in the versification of this Epistle. The flattery thh
which it opens is cleverly written, and the verses towards the end, in whlch
Horace compendiously states the military successes of Augustus, are terso
and elegant.. His commendation of the poet is a fair tribute to his own pro-
fession. The description6 gf the vulgar taste for spectacles is natural, and re·

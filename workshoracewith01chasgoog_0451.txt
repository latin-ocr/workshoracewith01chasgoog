stated after Caesar's death, and made a military tribune Whether or no he
is different from the person mentioned below, v. 107, it is not easy to say

25. fierique tribuno i'] Each legion in the Roman army (the number varied
at different times, but at Philippi there were nineteen on, each side, each
legion consisting of about 6,000 men, rather less than more) had six tribunes
(the post Horace held in the army of Brutus), who' were their principal
officere. The military tribunes of the first four legions were entitled to sit in
the senate. ( See Epod. iv. 15, n.) As to the ‘latus clavus,’ see note on the
34th verse of the last Satire. ‘ Quo,’ ‘ to what purpose.' (See C. ii. 2. 9, n.)

27. Nam ut quisque insanus] -The senators' ‘calceus,' an ouuloor shoe,
was fastened by four thongs (‘ nigris pellibus '), two on each side, which went

· spirally up to the calf of the leg (‘ medinm crus '). These thongs were called

⁴ corrigiae,' and were black. The shoe itself appears to have varied in color.
⁰ 30. quo morbo Bonum His disease was a thirst for admiration among
women. He was a man of bad passione, it is said. But we do not know
much about him. He need not be identified with the man in S. 4. 110. A
foul-mouthed person of the same name occurs iu the next Satire (v. 8).

34. Sic qui promittit] This refers to the promises of candidates for office,
aud the three principa] megisti-acies are implicd: the city praetorship, in the
words ‘urbem sibi curae'3 the consulship, in ‘imperium et Italiam'; and
the aedileship‚ in ‘delubra deorum‚' because it was the duty of the aedile to
attend to the temples and other public buildings.

38. Syri, Macae, aut Dionysi] These were common names of slaves.
The practice of executin criminals by throwing them from the Tarpeian
Roek (part of the Mons gapitolinus) was not common in the latter period
of the republic. It was never applied to slaves, who were put to death,
chiefly by crucifixion, outside the city on the Esquilias. (See Epod. v. 99, n).
Cadmus is said to have been a public executione-r of that day.

40. At Novius] The upstart who is supposed to be addressed in the re-
vious lines, is a plebeian tribune, and he here affin-ms that, if his birth is ow,
that of his colleague Novius (whqmay be anybody, sce note on S. 3. 21) is
still lower. Freedmen, and persons following low trades, were admitted into
the senate, and forced into high magistracies by Julius Caesar, and it was not
till some years after this Satire was written that Augustus purged the senate
of these members. The woids ‘ gradu post me sedet uno ' may be a metaphor
taken from the theatre, of which··the first fourteen rows were assigned to the
Equites Epod. iv. 15, n.).

41. oc tibi Paullus Et Messalla] These were names belonging to two of
the most distinguished families of Rome, the AEmilia and Valeria. Horace
introduces the name Messalla probably out of compliment to his friend Cor-

· vinus, for whom he wrote C. iii. 21. As to ‘hoc,' in the sense of ‘propter

hoc,' see,above, S. l. 46, n. The same person who puts the question ‘tune ·
Syri, θεολ ’ is here supposed to rejoin, saying, that, though this worthy trib-

·une has a colleague a degree less illustrious than himself, he need not think
’ himself a Paullus3 and besides, though Novius be his inferior in one way, he
beats him in strength of lungs, “ and that is what we like,’' where the speaker
ironicall puts himself for the eople.

43. (gneum-amque om tria Jllnerass These would be public fimet-als, ‘fu-
ncra indictiva,' at w ich the corpse of the deceased was carried in procession
fmm his house, with the noise of trumpets and horns and fifes; and women
(‘ practicae ’) singing dirges3 and ‘ mimi,’ dancers and stage-playcrs, who
recited passages suited to the occasion, and sometimes acted the part of mer-
ry-andrcws‚ mixing mirth with woe3 and after these came men who repre-
sented the ancestors of the deceased, wearing mask‘s suited to each character;

and theu the corpse on an open bier, which was followed hythe relations and ·

friends, all dressed in black. They went thus in processioa to the Forum,

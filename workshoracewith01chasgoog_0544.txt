of art, its flelds and vincyards and ²climate‚ all conm‘butsd to make it the
most conspicuous island in the AEgean. ·
· 2. concinna Samos,] Samos (the island) is rough, bnt the town is meant,
and it is called ‘ concinna ' from its buildings, of which a temple of Juno was
one of the most conspicuous. Outside and inside, this temple was adorned
with the finest works of art. There was also a celebrated mole at Sanane,
made to protect the harbor, which would be an object of interest to a nav·
ouer.

2. Cmest‘ reyia Sardes,] The town of Sardes (αἱ Σάρδεις), o'r the greater
part of it, which was burnt to the ground in >the revolt of the Ionians, Β. c.
499, was originally built of slight materials‚ though it was the seat of enor-
mous wealth during the reigns of the Lydian kings, and especially that of
Croesus, whose palace became the residence of the Persian Sati-aps and was
beautified by them, especially by Cyrus the younger, whose gai-dens ane eele-
brated (Cic. de Senect. e. 17). .

3. Smyrna quid et Colophon ?] Alexander the Great found Smyrna in
ruins, and conceived the desig-n of rebuilding it, being prompted by Nemesis
in a dream. He did not live to do sc, but Antigonus began and Lysimachus
finisbed a new town on a magnificent scale. Strabo speaks of it a's one of
the most beautiful eities of Ionia. Among» other objecta of interest was a
temple erected to Homer, and called Homerium. The inhabitants claimed

him as their countryman, and showed a cave in which it was said he wrote·

lus ms. ·

Cffigphon, also in Ionia, on the Hales, was destroyed by Lysimachus, ‚with
Lebedus (v. 6). Its chief attraction was its neighborhood to the shrine of the
Clarian Apollo. At present, only a few huts stand on the site ef this town.

much the same meaning, being chiefly used in poetry. When ‘ vel ’ is used,
an indifference in the speakcr's mind is implicd as to which of the two cases

or objects be taken. ‘Ne,’ being attached to ‘euncta,’ shows that the em- ⁸

phasis lies on that word.

5. Attalicis ex urbibus ·One of the towns of the kingdom of Pergamum,
bequeathed by Attalus ΙΙ. to the Roman people, and constituted a Roman
province on the defeat of Aristonicus, 13.c. 129. The kingdom of Pergamum,
when it was handed over to the Romans, included Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, and

part of Caria, the principal cities of which (μητροπόλεις) were Ephesus,
Pergamum, Sardes, Smyrna, LampsacuS, CyzicuS. Other large towns were
Tralles, Adramyttium, Thyatira, δια, nearly all of which are shown, by the
ruins that remain, to have been built and ornamented on a magnificent scale.

6. An Lebedum hadas] LysimachuS, after the battle of Ipsus (3.0. 301),
when he became master of the western part of Asia Minor, destroyed the
towns of Lebedus and Colophon in Ionia, and transferred their inhabitants
to Ephesus Lebedus never seems to have been rebuilt so as to recover any
of its former importance, and the ruins of the old town probably helped to
cause the desolate appearance described by Horace. He writes as it· he knew
Lebedus, but did not know the other places he refers to before. He must
have seen this place, if at all, in his campaigning with Brutus.

7. Gabiis desertior] Gabii was an ancient town of Latium, an Alban colo·
n , 100 stadia from Rome. Juvenal mentions it as a place of reson for peo-
ple in humble circumstances, and calls it “ Simplicibus Gabiis ’ἕ ” (iii. 190).
· In Horaee's time, while cold bathing was the sashion under the advice of
Antonius Musa, it appears Gabii was resorted to· Horace may have been
there himself. See Eppz 15. 9. ·

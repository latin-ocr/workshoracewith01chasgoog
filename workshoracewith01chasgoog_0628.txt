“ ‘rho Blrds or Aristophanes lus elva-ys been sacerd-d ns one of his most ᾱοὶὶψι-
i'nl plecen- Like the clouds, ίι is compendnly l'ree stom the objectionsble liceum
ot thought und languzge which deforme sever-‚l of iiis plays ιο such n degree ιΙιιι
they cannot be used in schools end colleges. lt is true there are some passages
in this pisy uiso ιοο fmely executed3 but lt hu been decided‚ ou mature reflectiou,
ιο iet them stand, so es ιο om the dmm entire, on the principles which gulded
my decision in editing the clouds. 'l'he ιοκι of this edition is reprlnted from the
Poetae scenici of Dindorf. . . . . 1 have endeavoted ιο explain from other sources
u branch or the subject ιο which little attention hes heretofore been given3 — 1 moen
the intumi history of the birds, which are very entertuining figures among the per-
sons of the play. 1 suspected that the poet's selectiou of birds was not unde ιιι
random‚ but that, in every instance, they were chonen wlth a special meaning, and
to effect a particular purpose in point of art. In considet-ing the play from this
point of view, Ι have been much indebted ιο my friend end colleague, Professor
Agunia, of whose profound and comprehensive knowledge of ornithology 1 have
been permitted to evall myoelt in attempting ιο defen-mum the species or some of the
birds not hitherto identified3 end 1 have come ιο the conclusion thet, in sil enses,
the character end habits or the birds ere encely sud cariously adapted ιο the pom
they perform in the comedy, showing Aristophanes ιο have been a careful observet
or nature ns well as a consummate poet ..... Greet care has been taken ιο illus-
trate the political musicus, end the applicetion or Judicial expressions, iu the
course of the picco ..... The satire ot the birds is more playrul, comprehensive
and geniti than thet οἱ any other of the poet’s comedim. 'l'he spirit. ol· parody aad
bul-leoque, which 'is n general trait in the Aristophane drama, here displays ituit
. most ἵκει] and amusingly.

“ ‘l’he dithyrambic poete ln merul ere unspedngly ridiculed3 the philosophae
end men of seleuce ate ῐιοι allowed to pass uutouched3 while profligens end lul-
postors of every class and denerlptlon arc hene es well es in the ‘ clouds? held up
to soom eud contempt.”

From Prof- North of Humilem· Collega.

⁴⁸ Presldent Pelion hed intellectunl glaciati attaluments which especially fitted
him for the difficule work of editing Aristophanes. His edition of the ‘Birds of
Aristophanes‚’ published by sever, Francis, ἐι Co., is worthy to be more generally
introduced among the Greek studies in the colleges of our country.”

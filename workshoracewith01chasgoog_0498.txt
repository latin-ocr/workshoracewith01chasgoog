81. 'Vilibus in scopia] ‘ Scopae ’ were besoms for sweepingthe floors, weila,
and farnitum of a mom, usually made of the branehes of the wild myrtle og·
·tamarisk. The palm seems also to have been used. ⁴ Mappae ' here mean
-mwels or dustem to clean the fui-uitare aud walls. ‘ Scobe ' is sawdust‚ with
vwhich the floors were strewed. · It was sometimes highly scented. .
' 83. Ten lapides varios] ‘ Tene Ξ ’ is it for such as ,you‘ss ‘ Tene decet? ³
·The floors in the houses of the rich were laid with slabs of mar-hle and mosaic-
'work‚ and mai-hle slabs were also introduced in the walle, though paintings

⁵were more common. '‘ Torus’ meant properly a round pilloW, as is shown ·

-by its root ‘ter' (which appears in ‘tornuS‚' ‘ torqueo,’ ete.; see C. i. 1. 28,
*n.), and ‘ toralia’ probably means eoverings for the cushions, which were put
over the rich ‘ stragulae vestes ’ (see‘ last Satire, v. 118, n.), as wc put chintz
coverings over our farnitum when it is not in use, or on ordin occasions,
-Inviting his friend Torquatus to dinner‚ Horace tells him he wil take care
‘⁴ ne turpe toral, ne sordida mappa corruget nares.'' (Epp. i. 5. 22.)
- 85. oblitum quanto Catius says that the neglect of those matters which
eost little money an attention is more reprehensible thau the absence of fur-
niture, Which the rich only ean afford. “ The case he supposes is that of a man
who combines dirt with fine , slovenliness with ostentation.

88. Docte δοιῇ] Οαῐίιιε,ἵεινίῃὲζ bmught his discourse to an end with an
:exhortation upon deceno-y and order, Horace entreats him, wherever it is he
goes to get such lessons he will take him with him, that he may drink wis·
dom at the fountain-head. CatiuS, he sa s, no doubt repeats accuratel what
.he has heard, but, such precepts would {a more highly commended y the

aspect, bearing, voice, etc. of the teacher himself.

SATIRE V.

· In this Sati-re, which has a good deal of humor in it, Horace takes up the
practice of will-hunting‚ of which, as of many other degrading vices that
· afterwards pervaded Roman society, he saw only the beginning. Describing
·“ the ruge for miilzgpsghrggngylgl ἑξεῖ ἓοὲᾱῖιίἒῐζθέιῖἔίεἰὲα · sunt qui

Crustis et pomis viduas venentur avaras ‘

Excipiamque senes quos in vivaria mittant.” Δ
The practice wassufficiently common in Cicero's time. and Pliny connects it
“ with the growth of wealth, and the time when money began to be the instru-
ment οἷ ambition and the measure of respectability3 that is, he dates its birth
- from the decline of- the Republic.

Homer (Od ss. xi.) makes Ulysses go down to Hades and there meet
Teii-osias, the {beben prophet, who tells him of . the hardships that awaitcd
him in his journey home, where however in the end he is destined to arrive.
, Horace supposes a continuation of the interview, ,and makes Ulysses ask the·

seothsaycr how he is to repair his for-tunes when he g-ets home, and finds nis
ς property wasted by his wife’s suitors, a's the prophet told him it would be
- (see note on v. 6). Tciresias, though he implies that the cunning Ulysses
would bc at no loss in such a matter if he once got home, gives him his ad-

’ ,· vice, which is to lay himself out for pleasing old men and women of fortune,

and gettinssfr¹ named jn their wills, for which hc lays down a few ordinary
rules ε ‘of t ese, a persevering and course servility is the· chief. Ulysscs ap·

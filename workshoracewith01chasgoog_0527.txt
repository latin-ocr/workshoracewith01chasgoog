Asiatic shore of the Helles-pont. The other may vo been Sestos, 011. the

towns, and Abyd-os stood directly south of Sesms, at the dismo of thirty
stadia. The current runs very strong between them, and* thie is expensam·
in the texn notwithstanding which, there is a populu story thaz Leander, a
youth of Abydos, swam aevosa repeatedly by night, to visit Hem, the priest—
ess of Venus, at Sestos. Ovid has two Epistles, supposed to have passed
between the lovers (Hemid. 18, 19) ; and Vitgil (Gema. ili. 258, sqq.) nefers

9. Quid Tium Romana] Of Titius tho Scholiases say, thathe was a hagie,
and lyrie poen. According to. Horace, he was not afraid to imitate Pindon
albis young man was :pote rash than Horace himself (C. iv. 2. 1). There is
-ιιο, one apomrecord with whom the person in the text ean bo identified,
though eume suppose he may be the person Tibullus mendonfi (i. 4,, 73),
“ Haec mihi quae caneremq‘itio Deus edidit ore.''. .

venturus in ora 2] This expression may have taken its rise from Ennius's
‘⁸ volito vivu‘ per ora virum‚' which Vizgil has imitated oneo or twice.

· 142 Aa tragica desaevit et ampullatur] The first of these words refers to the
miens mpoesenoed in tragedy, the other to. the pompona words employed
&inferior writers to express them. ‘ Ampulla’ signifies a sort of bottle
with α, hig mund belly, and corresponds to the Greek λ ’κυθοῇ which was
uoed to eigmfy great, ewelling· wonls. Horace appears to ave been the first ·
to. mbstituoe the Latin wotds ‘ ampullari “ and ‘ ampulla ' (the figat of which
he probably eoined) for ληκυθὶζειν and λήκυθος. See A. P. 97.

15, Quid mihi Celsus ’t ἓ] ‘ Quid agis ' is the oemmon spnmda sor
‘How d’ e dos? See i. 9. 4 ; Epp. i. 8. 3. Celsus is most probably .
Celsus Affiinovanus, to whom the eighth Epistle is addressed. We know
⁸ ‘nothing of him, except that he wasone of the staff of Tiberius, and his secre-
tary (Romani scribaeque Neronis? 8., 2). The advice Homce here sends
him is, to. write something original, and not confine himself to.. the ideas of
other authors, either in the way of translation or imitation. It has been men-
tioned before (C. i. 31, Introduction) that Augustus attached, a nbmrll to the
temple be built for Apollo on the Mons Palatinus, AEsop's fable of t e ⁸ ck-
daw‘, who dressed himself in tho peaoock's cast-off feathors‚ is told by hae-

drus (i. 3). Αἰσώπειος κολοιός was a proverb.

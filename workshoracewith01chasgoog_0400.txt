HonAcn, meaning to write on the praiscs ‚of the country, put his poem into
the shape of a rhapsody by a money-getting maret, who, after reciting the
blessings of a country life, and sighing for the enjoyment.of them, resolving
to throw up his busineSS, and persuading himself that he dcsires nothing so
much as retirement and a humble life, finds habit too strong for him, and
falls back upon the. sordid pursuits which, after all, are most congenial to
him. Though the greater part of the speech must be admitted to be rather
out of keeping with the supposed speaker, yet the picture is very beautiful,
and the moral true. In the,most sordid mincis more genial impulsent⁷ will
sometimes ,arise 3 but the beauties of nature and the chax-ms of a pcaccful
retirement are, like virtue itself, only attractive in the distance and at inter-
· vals ,to the minds that have grown addictcd to the pursuit of gain for its own
sake. To such minds domestic and innocent pleasures offer no lasting grati·
fication and the picture of rustic enjoyment on the one hand, aud of the Jadcd'
but stili grasping usurcr struggling for a moment against his propensities on
the other, affords a wholesome lesson for many.

· 30. ‘canusini more Minya& 9] As to Canusium, see S. 5. 91. “It was ohe,
of those Greek towns which remained lon st and most 'purely- the language
of its founder-S, as we may suppose fmm t 1e text.

36. Turpidus Alpinus] This is supposed to be a bad poet named M. Fu-
rius BibaculuS‚ born at Cremona B. c. 102. ‘ Tur-gidus ' refers to his person.
Horace describes him elsewhere as “pingui tentus omaso ” (S. ii. 5. 40),
where a bombastic verse of his is quoted, which may account for his being
called familia-rly, by his contemporarieS, Alpinus. Horace speaks of his mur-
dering Memnon, and it is generally supposed that this refers to a translation
he made of the Aethiopis of Arctinus, one of the Cyelie poete, in which
Memnon was one of the principal heroes

37. Definyit Rheni luteum capue,] Horace says that Furius, like some rude
artist, had made a figure of Rhenus (the Rhine) with a head of clay, referring
· to the statues by which the different river-gods were represented, and to some
description this- poet had given of the Rhine, perhaps in a poem he is said to·
{iia-vla ¹writterfii on ‚the Gallie war. ‘ Defingo is ⁴ to fashion out,’ and differ-s

38. Quae ηεῗῖιε in aede sonent] Sp. Maecius Tarpa vwas the officer who
lieensed' plays before they were acted. He is mentioned again in the Ars
Poetica (ν. 387). His duties had previously formed part of the functions of
the, aediles, and it was not till political allusions became· common, and the

the Muses are referred to by Juvenal (S. vii. 37) as the resort of poeta, and
other temples besides (see Ovid. Trist. iii, 1. 69) had buildings attached where.
:men of letters assembled. In one of these, therefore, or some building ‘espe-
cially consecrated to the MuseS‚ poets who had plavs they wished to get rep-·
resented reeioed them, robably in the presence of Tarpa. .

42. Unus vivorum, FEndani ,·] Of this FundaniuS, who Horace says was
the only man of the day who could write a comedy in the style of Menander
and that school, nothing whatever is· known. He is the narrator of the scene
in S. ii. 8, the supper of Nasidienus. Probably Horace exaggerated his mer-
its‚ as well as Pollio’s, out οἳ· affection for the men. As to Pollio, see C. ii. l,
Int., and v. 10, n. ‘Regum,’ such as the “sacra Pelopis domus'' (C. i. 6.
8, n.). ‘Pede ter percusso ' refers to the trimeter iambie, the common meas-
ure of tragedy. ,

44. Ut nemo Varius ducit ,·] As to Varius,- see the Ode last mentioned, vv.
8, ll, and S. 5. 40. The derived significatione of ‘ducere’ are various. As
applied to a poem, it is probably taken from the process of spinning. See
Epp. ii. l. 225: “tenui deducta oemata filo.'' See also S. ii. l. 4.

45. Vz'ryt'lebl Whether Virgi had at this time published his Georgica or
not is quite uncertain, from the doubt that hangs over both the date of this
Satire and the publication of those poems. But, at any rate, virgil had them
in hand, and his friends had probably heard a great part of the-m recited in

rivate. The Bucolies had been published some nme, and they seem to
Have been thought well of, though until the Aeneid had made some progoess
we have no reason to suppose that Virgil was classed by his contemporaries
with¹ poets of the first rank. ⁴ Facetum ⁹ signifies ‘ elegant‚' as in acoxcomb
it would be called ‘ fine,' S. 2. 26.

46. Hoc σας] Horace says, ‘Fundanius may write eomedy better than
any man living, Pollio tragedy, Varius e ies, Virgil pastorals : this (satire)
was what, after Varro and some others ad tn’ed it in vain, 1 was able to
write better than they, though not equal to its inventor ' (Lucilius). who he
means by ‘ some other3,’ it is impossible to say.

· ⁴. Varrone Atacino] P. Terentius ‘Varro was a poet os the day some years
older than Horace. He was called Atacinus from the Atax‚-a·river of Gallia

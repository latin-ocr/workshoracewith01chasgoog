'this edition of Horace is substantially the name with the Abridgm ent of the
celebrated edition of Maeleane in· the ‘⁶ Bibliotheca. Classica‚’‘ only such changes
having been made iu the notes as seemed necessary to adnpt them ιο the use of
studente in the colleges and schools of the United states. 'l'he Arg-umente of
the Odee have been introduced from the larger- νοτὶς and Dr. Beek's Introduction
ιο the notros hae been appended to the Notas.

'l'he text is the same as in the larger edition. There may be found some little
changes in the respect of interpretation, but not such as to cause any embarrass-
ment to those who may huppen to consult both editions. Discussions respecting
the various readings have been omitted ; the informat-ion and assistance contained
in the introductione have been for the most part condensed and transferred to the
Notos. A few more passages have been translated, and some notes have been added
which were not thought necessary in the larger edition. · General remarks have
been almost entirely omitted, as well as discussions on disputed points and the
various opinions of other editions. ·

The high character of the English edition of Mucianae, as wellas the skill of the
American Editor ln his preparation of the work, have re'ndered the present edition

'highly acceptable in the various collegas and seminarias where lt hae come into

“The text was alreadypprinted before the editor undertook the preparation of the
notes. Itis simply a reprint of that of Klotz, as it appears in the Teubner edition,
published at Leipzig. In a few cases various readings have been given in the notes,
where they affor-ded aid iu the explanation of any particular passage. The editions
consulted in the preparation of the notes are those of Professor Ramsay, Glasgow,
. 18583 of Klotz, Leipzig, 1835 -393 of Classen, Bonn, 18313-of Georgo Long, London,
18553 of Garatoni, Naples, 1789, and the Commentary of Manutius. 'l'he gram-

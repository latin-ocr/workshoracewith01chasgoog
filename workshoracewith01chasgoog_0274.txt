21. Teucer] Teucer was brother of Ajax, and son of Telamon, king of
Salamis, that island on the southern coast of Attica where Themistocles
defeated the forces of Xerxes. When he returned from Tro , his father
refused to receive him, because he came without his brother, w ereupon he
went with his followers to Cyprus, and built a city there, which he called
after his native place, Salamis ‘ Cum fugeret tamen ' is an imitation of the

Greek καὶ φεύγων ὅμως. But this use of ‘tamen ' is not uncommon in
Cicero. Teucer selected Hercules as his protector, and so wore a crown of
poplar, which was sacred to that hero. See Virg. Aen. yiii. 276.

alone had the power of taking the auspices under which the war was carried
on. The difference between ‘ dux ’ and ‘ auspex ’ was the difference between
a commander who had the ‘imperium ’ (and therefore the ‘ auspicium ’) and
one who had not. If an ‘imperator' commanded in person, the war was
said to be carried on under his ‘ ductus ' as well as his ‘ auspicia ’3 otherwise
only under his ‘auspicia,’ his ‘legat-us ' being the ‘dux.' Thus Tacitus·
says (Ann. ii. 41), “recepta signa cum Varo amissa ductu Germanici au-
spiciis Tiberiil’ Tiberius as ‘ imperator’ alone had the ‘ auspicium,’ which
the emperors rarely delegated to their generals· See last Ode, v. 4. C. iv.

As to ‘Liberss see Epp. i. 19. 4, n. There is additional confusion here by
the Latin adjunet ‘ pater’ being affixed to his name. Dionysus, Hercules,
Castor, and Pollux were the·favorite heroes of the Greeks, who attributed,
chiefly to their labora the civilization of the worm, and to their care its pres-
θεν tion.

sqq. Angustus during his life refused to receive the honor of a tem at
Rome, and in' the provinces he would only have them if the name of ome
was coupled with his own. He had two of this sort in Asia Minor, and ono
built by Herod the Great at Caesarca. A temple in the provinces was aa .
honor which the governors often enjoyed. During his life, Augustus desired
to be accounted the son of Apollo, and was represented on coins in the ehar-
acter of that god playing on a harp. After his-death, several temples were
ereeted to him, and his worship was regularly established, but the altars Hor-

natiou. See s. ii. a. 266, 271.

23. Sicfimtor mrum] Augustus was particularly simple in his languago,
and had a. contempt for affectarint» of any kind. He would therefore, as
Orelli says, be pleased with these remarks of Horace.

pointed‚ with absolute powers for one year, to draw up a code of lawa, of -

which the greater part was finished in that year, and engraved upon ten.
tables of ivo or bronze. In the following year the decemvirum was renewcd‚

with the di erenee that three plebeisns were elected among them, and two
more tables were added. These tables contained the fundamental principles

mitted to memory by boys at school. As to ‘sanxerunt,' see S. ii. l. 81, n.

which Gabii (Epp. i. ll. 7, n.) came into the hands of the Romans· Another
historiari mentions having seen a treaty made on that occasion. ‘ Gabiis’

and ‘ Sabinis ' are both gevemed by ‘euml Compare C. iii. 25. 2, “quae

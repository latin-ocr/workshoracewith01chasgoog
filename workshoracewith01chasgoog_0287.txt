Diana (C. . 69), so called from its cold tempere-ture· It is elsewhere called

ODE XXII.

Amsrms Fuscus was an intimate friend of Horace, and the wa whom
he represents as playing him false on the Sacra Via (S. i. 9. 61). oraee
and he were -

“ paene gemelli,
Fraternis animis; quiequid negat alter, et alter3
⁰ Adnuimus pariter3 vetuli notique columbi '' (Epp. i. lo).
We know nothing more of him except that lie is said to have been a writer
of pla'ys and a grammarian. ³

FuscuS, as usual, has not much to do with the Ode, which relates how a
wolf fled from the poet as he was walking in the woods‘ on his own estate,
making verses on Lalage ; showing that an honest man is always safe.

Axoume-ur. — An honest man, FuscuS, may go unarmed along the burn·
ing shores of Africa, over the wild Caucasu3‚ or to the fabulous East. As 1
wandered careless in the woodS, singing· of my Lalage, a wolf, such as Apu-
lia and Africa rear not, met me, and fled! Set mein the cold and stormy
North, or in the burning and uninhabited tropic, still will 1 love my smiling,

prattling Lalage.

l. Integer vitae sceler-ismae punis} These are Grecisms, but not peculiar- to
Horace. Virgil, for instance, has ‘animi maturus Aletes ’ (Aen. ix. 246„

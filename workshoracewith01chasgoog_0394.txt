374 · notras.

ace therefore does not use the word in its legal sense. The Getae‘ lay towards
the mouths of the Danube, while the Daci were situated to die west of mem,
on the same οι· south side of the river.

23. 'Serae— Tanain] See C. iii. 29. 27, n. The Seres and Indi are not
much distinguished by Horace (see C. i. 12. 56), and, when he is referring ω
the East‚ their names are genet-all associated with the Parthiam, more for
the s‘ake .of.amplification than with istorical or geographica} accuracy. 'rho
Roman armies had not yet even crossed the Tigris. But when Augustus was
in Syria, we are informed by SuetoniuS‚ ambassadors came from the far East
to ask his protection and alliance.

25. lucibus] This word is used for ‘diebus' by Ovid (Fast. iii. 397) :—

“ His etiam conjux apicati cincta Dialis
Lucibus impexas debet habere comas.”
The sin lar is more common.

29. „inlesum-tos] This is a concise way of expressing ‘ virtutis munem
functos,’ as in Cicero (Tusc. i. 45): ‘⁴ Nemo parum diu vixit qui virtutis ,per-
fectae perfecto functus est munere.” ,

more patrum] Cic. (Tusc. i. 2) tells us that in the Origines of Cato it is

stated that it was the custom of old to sing songs at meals upon the virtues ·

of great men. The practice may have been partially revived in Horace’s day.
The conclusion of this Ode recalls C. iv. 5. 31, sq.

30 Lydis] Plato tells us that the Lydian and Ionian melodies were best
suited to delicat-y and feasting, the Boi-ian, and Phrygian to wat-3 and Aris-
totle that the Lydian were most suitable to the tendet age of boyhood, as
harmonizing the mind and training it to good. There is no particular force,
however, here in the word ‘ Lydis) As to ‘tibiis,’ see C. i. 1. 32, n. The
pipes used ⁸by the Lydians themselves are called by Herodotus (i. 17) αὐλός
ἀνδᾶοὴῑος and αὐλὸς γυναικὴἳος, probably as representing the voices of a man
an a woman respectively.

31. Anchisen] The family of Anchises, the grandfather of Iulus, are 'rnen-
tioned hem, because Augustus belonged ‘by adoption to the Julian family, of
which Iulus was the reputed founder. ·

EPODE 1.

anr Augustus had determined on the expedition against MsAiitonius*
and Cleo atra, which led to the battle of Actium, Β. c. 31, he summoned, asi
we leam mm Dion Cassius (50. 11), the leading senators and men os Eques-¹
trian rank to meet him at Brundisium, for the benefit of their counsel, and
(the historiam says) to keep the Equestrians from mischicf, and also to show
the world the harmony to which he had brou ht men of all orders at Rome.'
Maeeenas obeyed this summons, and went to rundisium, but was sent back
by Augustus towateh over the peace of the city and the affairs of Italy. It
is ve v possible that Maecenas may have had the offer of a command on tha
expe ition against M. Antonius, and that both he and Horace believed he

oing on. that service, until, on his arrival at Brundisium, Augustus
ugqxt fit to send him back to discharge more important duties at Rome}
Horace, supposing him to be ing, wished to accompany him, but Moeeenas
would not allow it (v. 7), w 1ich gave occasion sor this Epode. lt is an
affectionate remonstmnee against being left behind.

Auentinum—Thou art going into the midst of danger, Maecenas, to
share the foi-tunes of Caesar. Shall 1 stay at home at ease, or meet the
danger with thee, on whose life my hap incss depends ’ἒ 1 will go with thee
withersoever thou goest. To what en shall I go'l As the bird scars less,
for her young when she is near them, so shall 1 sear less for thee, if 1 go with
thee, and I go to win th love, not thy favers- Thy love hath given me
enough. d·1 seek not wide ds or fine houses and cattle, and gold to hide or
to squan er.

1. Liburnis These were light vesseIS, that took-their name from the ships
used by the iburnians‚ a piratica! tribe on the Illyrian coast. . Augustus
employed them in his expeditioris against Sex Pompeius, and thcy were of
great use at Actium,(C. i, 37. 30). All writers on the battle of Actium de·
scribe the ships of M. Antonius and Cleopatra as of enormoussize. Like
those of the GreekS‚ which the Romans copied, the Egyptian vessels were
fitted with towers (‘1›ropugnacula ’), from which the men fought.

4. subires-mo] ‘ 'l'uo pericnl0,’ ‘ meo‚’ ‘suo‚' ‘nostro,' are all common,
and ‘ periculum ' is used in the ablativo case in ⁴ summo periculo,' ‘ minimo
periculo,’ where th05ablative is an ablative of eost, and is not to be explained

su l in ⁴ eum.

'yffi ειξηζο &guars This sentence is not complete ς ⁸ ibimn8,’ or something of

. that sort, must supplied. ‘ Shall 1, at thy bidding‚ seek reposo, which

hath no pleasure if not shared by thee, or go to bear this danger with the
heart with which the hardy soldier ought to bear it ’ἒ ’

12. ΙηΙιοσρὶεαΙεηα -ΟαυαιωηιᾸ This is repeated from or in C. i. 22. 6.

16. firmas parum 9] , This is probably taken from the Greek ἄναλκις,
which oes commonly with. ἀπτόλεμος (as Doering· says).

19. 't assidens] ‘ As a bird sitting on her⁴ unfledgcd brood feam the
serpent’s stealthy coming more if she leave them, though not likely to help
them more if she be' near and they before her.’ ‘ Relictis ’ is the dative.

⁴ Supposing that ’ is a common meanin of ‘ ut ’ with the subjunctive. ‘ Ut ·

adsit‚’ sollewed by ‘ praesentibusss is er redundant. But such repetitions

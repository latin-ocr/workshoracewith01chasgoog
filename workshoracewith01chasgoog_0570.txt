86. Jam Saliare Numae carmen] · See C. ἰν. 1. 28, n. The hymn: of the
Salii appear to have been very obscure3 but there were those who thought
themselves elever enough to make them out, which Horace takes leave to

verses to Numa, who established the Salii of Mars.

93. Ui* primum positis Here follows a description of the Atheniens, as
they quieldy became a ter the Persian war (B. c. 480), and especially under

95. athletarum studiis] The term ἀθλητής (from ἆθλα, the prizes of vie—

games (the Olympian, Isthmian, Nemean, and Pythian) for prlzes in exer-
cises of personal strength, as wrestling‚ running, boxing, leaping, throwing
the discus or javelin. The honor that was paid to successful ⁶ athletae ' was
enormous. They were introduced at Rome about two centurias Β. 6., and
⁴under the emperors were a privileged class, and formed a ‘ collegium!

turned from arms to the arts of peace, and he justifies the change (103-167 ).

ennea-Boon 1v. 365

Ilium the oni-y city th'at has· been sacked3 nor the heroes of the Iliad all that
have fonght; but the rest have been forgottem because the have no poet to
sing of them. Buried virtue is little better than buried d ness. Ι will not,
therefore, let thy labors pass unsnng, Lollius 3 thy sagacity and uprightness,
thy mind free from avarice and secure from corrupt-ion. Itis not the pos·
sessor of riches that is wealthy, but the man who knows how to use the gifts
of Heaven, and to endnre porei-ty, who hates corruption, and is ready to lay
down his life for his country or his friends.

1. Ne fhrte] ‘ Lest perchance you should suppose— remember that, even
if Homer stands first, Pindar is not fon-gottw! For other examplcs of ⁴ ne '
thus used, see S. ii. 1. 80; Epp. i. l. 133 18. 58; ii. 1. 208; A. P. 406.

2. natus ad Aufidum] Though Horace says he was born near the Aufidus,
Venusia, his native town, was fifteen miles south of that river, on that branch
’of the Via Appia which leads from Beneventum to Talentum. The Aufidus
(Osanto) is invariablv described by Hdrace as a boistemus river (see C. iii.
30. 103 iv. 14, 253 S. i. l. 58). But the character of such streams varies
with the season of the ear.

8. Stem‘cllmiqtoe ‚qraoes Camenae .·] The muse of Stesichorus is called
‘graviS,' as, though a lyric poet, he chose for his subjects principali those
which belonged to Epic poetry, as wars and beroea, and so forth. He was
born at Himera in Sicilv, about the middle of the seventh century B. c. ·

12. Aeoliae—puellae] Sappho. See C. i. 1. 34. ·

ι 13. arsit] This governs ‘crines’ as ‘mirata' governs the other accusa-
tives. · See C. ii. 4. 7, n. Laodamia writes thus to her husband of the eharms

17. tela Cydonio] Teucer is described by Homer as ἄριστος Ἀχαιῶν ‚
τοξοσύνῃ (11. xiii. 313). Cydon was a town of Crete, and the Coetans were ‘⁶
famous archen. See C. i. 15. 17, n.‚ and compare Virg. Ecl. x. 59: ‘⁴ Tor-
qucre Cydonia cornu Spicula.'’

2οι Idomeneus Sthenelusve] The first of these led the Cretam, and the
other the Argives, in the Trojan war. Deiphobus was Hector’s favorite

buried in'oblivion. There are some well-known verses in Gray's Charch-

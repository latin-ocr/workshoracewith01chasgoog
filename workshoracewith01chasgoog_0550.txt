eloth, but there were lighter and finer sorts for summer. These were called
‘rasae,' because the nap was cli ped close. ‘Nitidi'capilli' refers to the

EPISTLE XV.

{No-rmus is known of the person to whom this ‘E istle was written. He
is called, in the MSS. inscript-ione, C. Numenius V a. It appears that he

was acquainted with the southern coast of Italy, and Horace, who had been -

recommended by* his physician no longer to go (as he had been wont) to
Baiae, had a mind to try one of the southern ports; and he writes to Vala
for information about them. It is an unconnectcd sort of Epistle, with a long
digression upon the lament of Baiae at the loss of hei· invalidS‚ and another
upon wines, and a third, which occupies half the Epistle, u on the profligacy
of one Maeniu5‚ who squandercd all his moncy on goo living, and 'then
turned to living at the expense of others. When hc had nothing better, he
ate tripe, and abused all spendthrifts ς and as soon as he had got any money,
he spent it in the same way again. Such am Ι, sa s Horace ; when I am
short of money, I commend the screnity of a humb e life; when a windfall
drops in, 1 am ready to be as extravagant as you pleaser v
All this has not much connection with the professed object of the letter.

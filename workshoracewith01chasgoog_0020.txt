from the Epistle to Florus, that Horace at this time had to resist.
the urgency of friends begging him ιο write, one in this style
and another in that, and that he had no desire ιο gratify them
and to sacrifice his own' ease to a pursuit in which it is plain he
never took any great delight. He was likely to bring to it less
energy as his life was drawing prematurely to a close, through
infirmities either contracted or aggravated during his irrational
campaigning with‘ BrutuS, his inaptitude for which he appears
afterwards ιο have been perfectly aware of. He continued to
apply himself to the study of moral philosophy till ⁵his death, .

which took place, according to EusebiuS, on the 27th of Novem- ·

ber, Β. c. 8, in the fifty-seventh year of his age, and within a
few days of its completion. Maecenas died the same year, also
towards the close of it3 a coincidence that has led some ιο the
notion, that Horace hastened his own death that he· might not
have the pain of snrviving his patron. According to SuetoniuS,
his death (which he 'places after his fifty-ninth year) was so
Sudden, that he had not time to execute his will, which is opposed
to the notion of suicide. The two friends were buried near one
another ‘⁶ in extreinis Esquiliis,” in the fas-thesi: part of the Es-
quiliae, that ie, probably, without· the city waHS, on the ground

drained and laid out in gardens by Maecenas. (See S. i. 8, In-
troduction.)

When Augustus returned from Asia, in Β. c. 29, and closed .
the gates of JanuS, being the acknowledged head of the republic,
Horace appeared among his most hearty adherents. He wrote
on this occasion one of his best Odes (i. 2), and employed his pen
in forwarding those reforms which it was the first object of Au-
gustus to effect. (See Introduct10n to C. ii. 15. ) His most

Qtriking Odes appear, for the most part, to have been written after
the establishment of peace. Some may have been written before,
and probably were. But for some reason it would seem that he
gave himself more to lyric poetry after his thirty-fifth year than
he had done before. He had most likely studied the Greek poets
while he was at AthenS, and some of his imitations may have been
written early. If sn, they were most probably improved and
polished, from time to time, (for he must have had them by him,
‘known perhaps only to a few friendS, for many yearS,) till they
became the graceful specimens of artificial composition that they
Uare. Horace continued to employ himself 1n this kind of writing
(on a variety of subjectS, convivial, amatory, political, moral,—-·

some original, many no doubt suggested by Greek poems) till l

. Β. c. 24, when there are reasons for thinking the first three books κ

· of the Odes were published. During this period, Horace appears l
· to have passed his time at Rome, among the most distinguished ,
men of the day, or at his house in the country, paying occasional ÷

visits to Tibur, Praeneste, and Baiae, with indifferent health,

which required change of air. About the year Β. c. 26 he was ε
nearly killed by the falling of a tree, on his own estate, which χ

accident he has recorded in one of his Odes (ii. 13), and occa-
sionally refers to; once in the 'same stanza with a storm in which
he was nearly lost off Cape PalinuruS,* on the western coast of
Italy. When this happened, nobody knows. After the publica-
tion of the three books of odes, Horace seems to have ceased
from that style of writing, or nearly s0‚ · and the only other com-
positions we know of his having produced in the next few years
are metrical Epistles to different friendS, of which he published
a volume probably 1n Β. c. 20 or 19. He seems to have taken ·'

172. spe lonqus, ‘ Slow to hope.' ‘Avidus futuri’ mans ‘eager to live .
longer,’ or ‘ gree y of life.’ Both these expressions are unusual.

175. Multa serunt anni] See C. ii. 5. 14, n.‚ and Epp. ii. 2.· 55. The re'-
mark seems to be drawn forth by the dark picture of old age contained in the

180. Seynius irritant animos] When Candaules proposes to exhibit his
wife's beauty to Gyges, Herodotus (i. 8) makes him say ὦτα γὰρ τυγχάνει
ἀνθρώποισι ἐόντα ἀπιστότερα ὀφθαλμῶν, and Seneca (Epp. vi.) has a like
saying, “ Homines amplius oculis quam· auribus credunt.''

184. facundia praesens,] An eyewitness, who tells the s ectators ‚what he
has seen, and does itin the flow of a long, set speech. Τ 's is the part of
the messengers and heralde, of which one or more appears in every Greek
tragedy. ‘Praesens ’ means ‘before the audience!

186. coquat exta nefarius Atreus‚] See C. i. 6. 8, n. ; and as to Procne, see

C. iv. 12. 5, n. Short fragments of the Atreus of Sophocles and Cadmus of ⁶

Euripides are extant. The story of Cadmus and his wife Harmonia changed
into snakes is told by ovid (Met. iv. 563, sqq.). Such barbarities and mirac-
ulous changeS, Horace saJS, may answer in nar-ration, but if represented on
the stage are both incredible and disgusting. He inay have had some in-
stance of this kind in view. See C. i. 6. 8, n.; ii. 1. 10, n.; S. i. 10. 42, n.

191. nec deus intersit] It was a reproaeh against the tragediam, that, when
they did not know how to bring their plot to a close, the had recourse to a
god. The gods were introduced on a platform above. enee the proverb,
“ Deus ex machina,'' sor an summary way of winding up a· plot, or extri-
cating one’s self from a difliyculty. ‘ Dignus vindice’ means worthy of such
intervention. .

192. nec quarta l αι’ persona laboret] Thespis first introduced a single
actor on the stage, w o perhaps told α’ story and served to relieve the chorus.
AEschylus introduced a second, and so brought regular dialogue into the
drama. Sophocles added a third, and this number was rarel if ever ex-
ceeded. (See Epp. i. 18. 14, n.) The Romans obser-ved no suc restrictionj
but it must always be t‘he case, if more than three actors are on the stage at
once, that some of them can have but little to say.

193. Actoris partes chorus] The chorus should sustain in its place, and to ·
the best of its power, the part of an. actor} that is, instead of singing what is
irrelevant to the plot, it ought to carry on the action. ‘ Officiumque virile
defendat’ is a way of expressing‚ ‘it must sustain a strennuus part,' or ‘do
its duty strengously! Horace uses the expression ‘ defendente vicem ’ in the
same sense . i. 10. 12 . ·

196. Ille lionisffiveatqaele] The chorus is to utter sentiments showing favor
to the good, and giving them friendly counsel, tempering the wrath of the
⁸ passionate, and affectionate to the virtuous (which is in some degree a repc-
tition of the first clause), commending temperance, justice, laws, and peace. ·
The* business of the chorus was to utter such reflectione as any indifferent
persons might conceive on the aetion before'it, and to address those reflec-
tions to the characters represented, as one might address them to real persons
under the same circumstances. .

198. 'mensae brevis] Compare Epp. i. 14. 35, “coena brevis juvat '³ 3 and
with “apertis otia porti3‚” compare C. iii. 5. 23‚· “portasque non clansas,'’
representing a picture of national security and peace. The chorus, to whom
the principal persons communicated their intended crimes and deepest plots,
· were held to secrecy as a prime duty. Thus, Medea tells the chorus her in-

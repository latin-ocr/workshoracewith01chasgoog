(C. S. 25). The Parcae, who correspond to the Greek Μοῖραι, were god-
desses, whose effice it was to execute the decrees of Jove (ι fata ’), which .
therefore they knew, and were said sometimes to reveal. They attended
men at their birth, aud foretold their character and fortunes, and so Horace
says Parca gave him the gifts he mentions. The original conception, which

Homer adoptet, supposed but one Μοῖρα. and Horace uses the singula-r
number. But according to the later notions there were three. See next

Οΐῖῖιῦῥηιαῖι] ‘ spitesul,' which Horace says feelingly, for he had suffered

from their malice. .

ODE XYII.

Tan last two lines of this Ode, showing that Horace had not yet paidthe
sacrifice he had vowed to Faunus for his preservation from death, makes it

· most probable that it was written not long after C. 13 of this book, n. c. 25

or 26. In the same year Moecenas appears to have recovered from a sever,
and to have been' received with applause in the theatre on his first appearance
after his illness (C. i. 20. 3). But his recovery seems to have been only
partial 3 and it would appear that Horace had to listen to his complaints and
apprehensione, of death, his fear of which is said to have ,been great. Horace
remonstrates with his friend in an affectionate way about his complaints aud
apprehensions. ·

Anemmnr. - kill me with thy complaints ’.ἱ 1 cannot survive thee,
Maecenas3 one half o my life being gone, how should the other ,stav behind 3,

1 have sworn to die with the'e, and the monsters of hell shall not se’parate us: “

Our star is one and the same. The power of Jove rescued thee from the
adverse influent-e of Satum on that day when thou wert received with accla-

2. amicum est] A translation of the Greek φίλον ἐστι’, and equivalent to
‘ acet! - ·

ps. altera) ‘ 1, the other part.’ Two definitions of friendship by Pythago·
ras are worth preserving. One is, σώματα μὲν δύο ψύχη δὲ μίας and the
other, ἐστὶ γὰρ ὥς φαμεν ὀ φίλος δεύτερος ἐγώ. Erasmus (Adag. Neaera
et Charmion) speaks of a custom of the Egyptians„ among whom it was
usual for persons to bind themselves by an cath each not tosurvive the other,

such persons being called ,οἱ συναποθνήσκοντες. This, if true, corresponds
with Caesar's account of the Soldurii (B. G. iii. 22).

7. Nec carus aeque} ‘ Carus ' requires ‘ipsi ’ to be supplied, as (Epp. i. 3.
29», ‘⁴ Si patriae volumus, si nohis vivere cari.'' ‘ Neither so dear (to my-
self as yon were to me), nor surviving with an entire life.¹ Horace and
’ Maecenas died the same year, and it has been unreasonably surmiscd, from
this coincidence and the language here used, that Horace hastened his own
death in order to accompuny his friend (Compare Epod. i. 5 )

11. (Ite-unque} For ‘ quan‹locunque,’ ‘ whenever.'

13. Chimaerae} See C. i. 27. 24.

14. Gyas} T1is name is sometimes written Gyges. It belongs to one of
the giants who made war upon Zeus.

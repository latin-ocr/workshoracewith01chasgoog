slept, and proeeeded next morning to Fundi (Fondi)‚ sixteen 'miles further to
the northeast of Tarracina. F’undi was situated on the north shore of a lake,
which was called after it Fundanus ; and also Amyclanus, from an old Greek
town Amyclae, the existence of which was only traditional when Horace
wrote, hut is occasionally mentioned by the poeta. Fundi was one of that
class of towns called ‘ praefectura,' which, instead of having the administra-
tion of its own affaire, was governcd by a ‘praefectus ' sent annually from
Rome by the Praetor Urbanus. At this time the ⁴ praefectus ’ was one Aufi-
dius Luscus (not otherwise known), an u start whom Horace calls Praetor
by way of ridicule. The officers of the ot ier munici l towns were allowed
to wear the ⁸ toga praetexta,’ the ‘ toga’ with a purple rder (Livy xxxiv. 7),
but the ‘ praefecti ’ were not, and yet Luscus wore it. The ⁴ latus clavus '
was a broad purple stripe down the front of the tunic, and was a badge that
belonged only to senators. ‘ Prunae batillum ' was a pan of hot 00818, which
may have been used for burning incense or otherwise in connection with sae-
rifice. But its use is uncertain. Aufidiae, it appearS, had been a ‘ scriba ’ or
clerk‚ probably in the praetor’s office, —— such a situation as Horace held at this
time in the quaestor'S. Persons in that ca acity had opportunities of pushin
their fortunes if they managed well, and t ie honors of Luscus are spoken ο
as ‘ praemia,' rewards of service rendered to his master.

. 37. In Mamm-mmm] Disgusted with the officiousncss of· the promoted
scribe, the party move on, in the course of thc day, to Formiae (Mola di

q Gaetu , about twelve miles further, where the road, having taken an upward

bend mm Tarracina to Fundi, goes straight down fmm thence to the coast,
where Formiae was situated at the head of the Sinus Caietanus. Its supposed
identity with the Laestrygonia of Homer has been noticed before (cdii 16.
34, n., and 17, Int.). As the scene of Cicero's frequent retirement, and his
death, it is a place of much interest Its wines Horace mentions more than
once. He here calls it the city of the Mamurrae, — a family of respectability
in this town, When the part-y got to Formiae, having travelled u wards of
twenty-five miles, they were tired, and resolved to pass the night iere. Li-
cinius Murena (C. ii. lo, Int , having a house at this lace, gave them the

use of it; but as he was not t ere himself. and probably ad no 'establishment ,

in the house suitable to the entertainment of such guests, Fonteius Capito
⁴invited his follow-travellers to dine with him. He therefore appears to have
had a house at Formiae likewise.

40. Sinuessae} Leaving Formiae next day, the party set out for Sinuessa,
eighteen miles distant. The road crossed the Liris (C. i. 31 7) at Minturnae,
and went down the coast till it reached Sinuessa, the most southcrly of the
Latin towns. The site is now called Monte Dragone (Cramer). It was on
the sea, and said to have been founded on the ruins of the Greek city Sinope.
Strabo (v. 234) derives its name from the Sinus Vescinus on which it stood.
Plotius Tucca a pcars to have been a native of Cisalpine Gaul. He was
associated with E Varius Rufus by Vin-gil, who loved them both, as the

execuxor of his will, and he was employed in the task of editing the AEneid’

after his death. Nothing more is known of him, hut what we gather from
this passage and S. i. 10. 81, that he was one of Maecenas's friendS, and on
intimate terms with Horace. As to L. ναι-ἰωῇ, see C. i. 6. l. S. i. 10 44.
45. Proxima Οιηιμαηο ponti] After Sinuessa, the Appia Via continued to
take 8 southerly direction, and crossed the Savo (Savone) about three miles
from that town, and just within the bordcrs of Campania. That river was
crossed by a bridge hearing the name Pons Campanus, near which was a
small house ereeted for the accommodation of persons travelling on public
busincsS‚ where there were officers appointed to supply them with ordinary

necessat-ies. Hence they were called ‘ paroehi,’ from the Greek παρέχειν.
In this house the party passed the night.

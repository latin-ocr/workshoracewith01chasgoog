C. Tanmrms Tuan was a jurisconsult of eminence, and a man of honor.
He was in the confidence of Angustus, and was consulted b him on legal
matters. Horace seems to ha've been well acquainted with im, though he
walsiglrggg gre-elgnggussglaythbffiofeoeghzngld la er a case for liis opinion, and

asks what he had better do to meet the malevo ence of his enemies. Trebatius ι

advises him to cease from writing, which Horace says is impossible· He was
born to write, and must do it. He has no capacity for heroic subjecte, and
has a passion for imitating Lucilius, to whom he pays a graceful compliment
by the way. Trebatius warns him that he runs the risk of being frozen to

death by his great friends, or of legal penalties for libel. But, trusting in the · ‘

goodness of his cause, he sets these dangers at defianee, and resolves to in-
dulge his inclination. . -

1. Sunt quibus - videor] Horace had undoubtedly in his mInd those par-
ticular opponente, on some of whom he had retorted in S. 10 of the last
book, and, this being the case, the indicative mood is wanted, rather than the
subjunctive, after ‘sunt quibus' (see C. i. l. 3, n.‚ and compare S. i. 4. 24).
By ‘tendere opus' Horace means he is charged with carrying his w‘ork or
mainfing it, beyond the ucenae propert?r allowed to satire. ‘sine nenlis ⁹
means ‘without vigor! As to ‘ deduci, see S. i. 10. 44, n.

4. Trebati,] See Introduction.
² 7. Optimum eran] Here as below (v. 16) the imperfect indicative is used
where the subjunctive might be expected. The Greeks in similar cases somess

times tdseg the {ffperfoet indicative without ἅν, where the usual construction

er uncti Transna'nto Tiberim] See S. i. 6. 123, n. The language is a
little in the style of a ‘ lex.' ⁴ Sub noctem ' means immediately after night-
fall. See Epod. ii. 44, n. S. ii. 7. 109. Epp. ii. 2. 169. It appears from
cicem’s letters to Trebatius that he was a ‘great swimmer, and Cicero de⁴ “
scribes himself as having gone home from his house one night “ bene potus
seroque ” (Ad Fam. vii. 22). He may therefore have lived pretty freely. '

10. rapit] There is some in this word, ‘ hurries you on like a torrent’

13. quivis] This corresponds to δ τυχών in Greek.

14. fracta pereuntes cuspide] Plutarch, in his Life of Marius (c. 25), re·
lates how, on the occasion of a battle with the Cimbri, he altered the spears
of the soldiers in such a way that they could not be of use to the enemy. He .
says that the spent-heads were formerly fastened to the shaft by two iron
nafis, and that MariuS, removing one, substituted for it a wooden peg, which

· would‘ give way when the spear struck the shield‚ where it would stick and

drag along the ground. From the ¹year B. c. 39 to 31, Augustus was en-
gaged at different times in subduing t e Gauls‚ and he included his victories
over them in ‘the first of his three days’ triumphs, in B. c. 29. ( See C. i. 2.

arms of Augustus, is a fficium he draws from his own imagination, in antici*

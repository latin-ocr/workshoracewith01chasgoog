(Milan). He was a slave, but afterwards received his freedom. He died
Β. c. 168, the year after EnniuS. His contemporaries held him in high estimas
tion. Cicero places him at the head of the comic pocta, but speaks ill of his

Latin. What is meant by '‘ gravitate ’ is as uncertain as ‘properare ’ in the ·

verse before, and for the same reason. ·

Terentius arta] The exact sense in which Horace ·meant this word is
equally uncertain with the others; perhaps it has reference to the elegance
of Terence's language, or the skill with which he draws real life in his plays,
There are few like him now. His name was P. Terentius Afer. He was a
'slave in the famil of one P. Terentius Lucanus, whose proenomen and gen-
tile name he too , on his manumission, retaining as a cognomen the name
which he derived from the place of his birth, Carthage. The plays we have

60. arcto stipata theatro] The plays of Terence and all the earlier and
more celebrated poets were performed, at first, either on scaffoldings erected
in the Circus, and afterwards taken down, or in temporary wooden theatres,
usually on a very large scale ; the notion being that a systematie encourage-
ment of plays, by the erection of permanent buildings, was injurious to pub-
lic morals, The first permanent stone theatre at Rome (for they had them
in the country towns some time before) was built by Cn. PompeiuS, after. the '
Mithridatio war, outside the walls, near the Campus Martiae.

62. Livi sm‘ptoris ab aem] T. Livius Andronicus is spoken of by Quin-
tilian as the first Roman poet. The date of his birth is uncertain, but he
died B. c. 221, or thei-eabouts. He wrote a translation of the Od vssey, and
plays. These were all, as far a‘s we knOW, ‘palliatae,' from t e Greek.
Cicero says they were not worth a second reading.

63. Interdum vulqus] The multitude, he means, are not altogether blind
tpl the defecta of these old writerS, though many think there is nothing like
t em. ’

66. dure— ζ nave] The first represents the harshness of the style, the
second its care essness. Compare A. P. 445. ‘Jove aequo ’ is the opposite
of ‘Jove non probante’ (C. i. 2. 19 .

70. playosmn mihi parvo Orbilium ictaress Orbilius Pupillus was a native
of Beneventum. In his fiftieth year (B. c. 63) he came to Rome and set up
a school. He seems ω have held the rod as the principle of school govern-
ment. He lived in great poverty, in a garret, to nearly a hundred years of

age, having long lost his memory. His townspeople were proud of him, .-

and emeted a marble statue to his memory. Orbilius was in his forty-eighth
year when Horace was born. He was therefore not young when the poet ‘
went to his school. As to ‘dictare,' see S. i. 10. 75, n. ⁴

73. verbum emicuit] ‘ If a decent word starts up.’

75. ducit venditque poemen] ‘ It brings forward and gives a value to the
whole poem.’ Compare Juvenal (vii. 135): “Purpura vendit Causidicum,
vendunt ameth stina.” ' · “

79. crocum ore ue perambulet Attae Fabula] Atta was a writer of come·
dies (‘ togatae ')‚ o which a few fragments remain. He died B. c. 78. It is
not clear that Horace had any particular play in mind, but it may have been
an affectation of Atta’s to have flowers scattered on the stage, on which it
was usual to sprinkle a perfume extracted from the crocus. The persume
was mixed with water and thrown u through pipes, so as to sprinkle not
onlvjhe stage, but the spectator-s. he most famous crocus was that of
1⁵ ·QorycuS, in Cilicia (see S. ii. 4. 68, n.). ,

Quae qrcwis Aesopus,] Claudius AEsopuS, the tragic actor, was an in· ·
timate friend of Cicero's, and most of the distinguished men of that time.
He was older than Cicero, though the date of his birth is not known, or that

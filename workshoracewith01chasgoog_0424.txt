them gratuitously. They were distinct from the professore or teachers 1
(Ἷιᾶνοοαῐί ’) and others, who were paid for their serviceS, and from ‘ora-
torcS,' though the ‘ consultus ’ sometimes combined with his calling as such
that of the ‘orator’ or ‘patronus.’ If we are to believe this statement of
Horace, and another to the same effect (Epp. ii. 1. 103), we must suppose
that these learned persons saerifieed their own convenience to the anxietv of
their cliente, and received them at a very early hour in the morning. ‘Jus '
embodied all law. As to ‘ leges‚' see Epp. i. 16. 41, n. On ‘laudat‚' see v.
3 n. ·
³ 11. datis vadibus] ‘ Vaces ’ were sureties provided by the -defemlaut, to
secure his appearance before the praetor at a time agreed upon between the· ,
plaintiff and himself. If 116 did not appear, he forfeited· the ame'unt· of tbe‘ '
‘vadimonium ’ or agreement, and his ¹ vades ’ were liable to· pay it if he did
not (see S. 9. 36, n.). The person here represented, therefore, is the defend-
ant in an aetion, going up reluctantly to Rome, to appear before the praetor
according to his agreement. ‘ Ille ' is as if the man were before us. ἲ
14. Ddassare valent] Though ‘ delasso ² does not occur-elsewhere, there is
no reason to suspect the word, or alter it. The intensive 'force of ‘de ’ is well
added to ‘ lasso.’ It corresponds to κατά, which has the same force. who
Fabius was, it is impossible even to conjecture with probability. ,

15. Siquis Deus‚] This is not a Roman way of speaking, but Greek, εἴ

δαίμων τις. ‘ En ego’ does not belong to ‘faciam,' but is absolute: ‘ Here

n I.’ ‘ Eia' is an exclamation of haste, ‘Awayi' ‘Nolint,’ ‘ they would

.ot' (οὐκ ἐθέλοιεν ἅν), is the apodosis to ‘si quis Deus.’ Compare S. ii. 7.

24: “ Si quis ad illa deus subito te agat, usque recuses.” ‘Atqui’ is an-

ffirgorm of ‘ atquin,' and ‘ quin ' represents ‘ qui‚4’ with a negative particle
'e .

18. partibus .·] An expression taken from the language of the theatre: ‘the
part you have to play ’ in life. '

21. Iratus buccas inflet,] An obvious, but not very reverential, representa-
tion of assion.

25. im] See O. ii. 10. 17, n.

27. Sed tamen amoto] ‘ Sed,’ ‘sed tamen,’ ‘veruntamen,' are often used, '
and especially by Cicero, not to express opposition, but after a parenthesis or
gigressissi, as here and C. iv. 4. 22. See, for another instance among many,
· ic. in err. ii. 3. 2.

28. Ille yravem] The cause of that discontent which was spoken of at the
beginning is here traced to the love of monev, each man thinking that his
neighbor is getting it fastcr than he is, and 'wishing therefore to change places
with him. But Horace does not mean that to be the only solution of the
universal discontent. That would be absurd, and· one at least of his own
examples would contradict his theory, the> jurisconsultus, who did not pursue
his laborious vocation for pay. He therefore shifts or limits his ground a
little, and dwells upon that which he supposes to be the most prevalent cause·
of discontcnt3 and with his ground he changes his examples. ‘ Nauta’ and
‘mereator ' here are the same person, the trader navigating his own ship.
(See C. i 28. 23.) ‘ Perfidus caupo' appears again in ‘ cauponibus atque
{naligais'ls i. 5. 4). ‘Per omne Audaces‘mare qni currunt’. is repeated

rom .i.3.9,s .

32. cibaria s] qsshis word, which is generally used for the rations of soldiers
or slaves, is used here ironieally for the humblest provision that can be made
for 3116 latter years of life, as if that was all that these rnen set before their
mm s. ·

33. nam evemplo est] ‘ for this is their model?

35. haud {qnam ac non incautafuturi] Experience tells her that times will
change, and instinct teaches her to provide against that change 3 she known

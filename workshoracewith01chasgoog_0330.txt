ODE XX.

'Pms Ode appears to have been written im romptu, in a mock-heroie or
but half serious style, in reply to an invitation op Maecenas (v. 6). The poet
says that he whom Maecenas delights to honor cannot fail to live for ever,
'and that he already feels his immortality, and that wings have been given
himhwith which he shall soar to heaven, and fly to the far-theat corners of the
&art . ‘

Anouunnr.— On a fresh, strong wing· shall I soar to heaven, far above
· envy and the world. Whom thou, dean· Maec-enas, delightest to honor, Styx
hath no power to detain. Even now my plumage is springing, and 1 am
ready to fly away and sing in distant plat-es, and to teach barbarous natione.
No wailings sor me; away with the empty honora of a tomb. “

¹ 1, 2. Non usitata nec tenui — Parma] ‘ On no common or mean wing.’
biformis] As swan and poet. '

onn8.— BOOK 1v. ’- ’ 371· '

Augustus, sufficiently deseri-be the spirit of it, though im professae purpose is

· to celebrate the part that Tiberius took, with DrusuS, in the vietor-ies over the
German tribes. It is probable that, whereas the Ode for Drusus was written
soon after his victory, this was not written till Augustus returned from Gaul,
two years afterwards· ⁶

Ancuunxr.— With what honors shall we erpetuate thy virtum, Ο
mightiest of princeS, whose strength the insolent indelici have felt? With
great slaughter Drusus cast them down from their heights, and Tiberius
drove them before him, as the south wind driven the waveS, or the swollen
Aufidus lays waste the corn,— a scathless victory; and thou didst lcnd thine
armieS, thy eonnsels', and thine auspices. ’T was fifteen years from that day
when Alexandria opened her gates to thee, that Fortune brought this glory-
to thine anns. All nations bow down to thee, from the east to the west,
from the north to the south, Ο thou guardian of Italy and Rome!

4. fimens Aeternafl As to ‘ tituloS,' see S. i. 6. 17, n., ‘and for ‘ fastoS,’ see'
Epp. ii. 1. 48, n. ‘Aeternam ¹ is a word which had probably become almost “
obsolete in Horaee’s time. Itis not found in any other author, except in a
fragment of Varro. Many words used by Horace, and by no other extant
writer, were probably common enough ,before the age of Cicero. . ‘ Habita·
biles oras? like ἡ οἰκουμένη, so commonly used by Plutarch and the writers
of the New Testament, significs the Roman world.

7. Quem -dt'de'ceoe — Quid Marte posse-3] This construction ie not uncom·
mon in Plantae, as (Asin. i. l. 45), ‘⁴ verum meam uxorem, Libane, scis quae
lis siet” ; and Terence, as (Eun. iv. 3. 15), “ Ego illurn nescio qui fuerit,''
and ether-places. With the Greek poete nothing is more common, as in
Sophocles (Trachin. 429) :—

π ὸς θεῶν φράσον, φίλη
δέσποινα, τόν ε τίς ποτ ἐστὶν ὁ ξένος-ς

10. Gmaunos,] The Genauni were one Qf the southern tribes of Raetia‚
lying between the lakes Verbanus (Maggiore) and Larius (Como), in the
modern Val d' Agno. The Breuni were a small but warlike tribe, also occu-
pying part of Raetia. The character Horace gives of these tribes is that which
:s given b all writers of the time. ⁴ Implacidum ’ is a word not found in any
writer ear ier than Horace. It is as likely that he 'made as that he found it:
either may be true. ·
, 13. plus vice sinaeplici ,Ἰ The literal version would thus be, ⁴ with more than
an even exchange, i. e. of blood, he being ‘ sine clade victor' (v. 32). As to·
the construction ‘plus vice,' see, C. i. 13. 20.

14. Δίῳ-οι· Νεῆπιῳι] Tiberius. see c. iv. 4. 28, n. ι

17. Spectandus — Quantis] ’ This seems imitated from the Greek idiom'

θαυμαστὸς ὅσοις. ² A noble sight, how in the strife of war he drove with ’
mighty slaughter those hearts devoted to a freeman’s death.’ ³
20. Indomitas prope qualis] It may be observed, that the fourth verse of
the Alcaie stanza is frequently constructed with a noun and its adjective in
the first and last place, and corresponding in their last syllables. In this Ode-
we have vv. 12, 16, 20, 36, 52, answering to this mle or habit. ‘Prope ’ has
:no particular force. Horace, whose ear was familiar withthe- lang-uage of tho
Greek tragediam, copied their σχεδόν τι (a common phrase in compar-isone)⁴
· here and in other laces, The setting >of the PleiadeS, at the beginningof
November, was rec oned as the commencement of winter; they therefore are
saidhto burst the clouds (‘scindere nubes ³), which poured down rain upon the
eart . ·
, 24. medios per §ques-J ‘ Ignes ’ means the flames of war. Δ

⁴ 25. tauriformis] This is taken from= the-Greek ταυρόμορφος, applied to ‘t'hq

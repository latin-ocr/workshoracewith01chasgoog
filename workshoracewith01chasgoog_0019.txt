up the study of the Greek philosophical writers, and to have
become a good deal interested in them, and also to have been a
little tired of the world, and disgusted with the jealousies his
reputation created. His health did not improve as he grew
older, and he put himself under the care of Antonius Musa, the
emperor's new physician. ¹* By his advice he gave up, for a time
at least, his favorite Baiae. But he found it necessary to be
a good deal away from Rome, especially in the autumn and
winter.† ’ ’ -

In Β. c. 17, Augustus celebrated the Ludi SeculareS, and
, Horace was required to write an Ode for the occasion, which he
did, and it has been preserved. Thi's circumstance, and the
credit it brought him, may have given his mind another leaning
to Ode-writing, and have helped him to produce the fourth book,
3. few pieces in which may have been written at any time. It
is said that Augustus particularly desired Horace to publish an-
other book of Odes, in order that those he wrote upon the victo·
ries of Drusus and Tiberius (4 and 14) might appear in it. The
latter of these Odes was not written, probably, till B.. c. 13, when
Augustus returned 'from Gaul. If so, the book was probably
published 1n that year, when Horace was fifty· -twa The Odes of
the fourth book show no diminution of power, but the reverse.
There are none in the first three books that surpass, or perhaps
equal, the Ode in honor of Drusus, and few superior to that
which is addressed to Lollius. The success of the first three
books, and the honor of being chosen to compose the Ode at the
Ludi SeculareS, seem to have given him encouragement. There
are no incidents in his life during the above period recorded or
alluded to in his poems. He-lived five years after the publica-
tion of the fourth book of Odes, if the above date be correct, and
during that time, Ι think it probable, he wrote the Epistles to
Augustus and Florus which form the second book3 and having
conceived the intention of writing a poem on the art and progress
of poetry, he wrote as much of it as appears in the Epistle to the
Pisones which has been. preserved among his works. It seems,

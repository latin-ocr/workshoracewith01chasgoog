C. ii. 10, Int. Who was the other brother of Proculeius is doubtful, and also
on what occasion he assisted them. They may have lost their property in
the civil wars, as the Scholiasts say. Proculeius was in great favor with
Augustae, and was intimate with Maecenas (who married his sister or cousin,
Terentia), and probably with Sallustius, He was alive at this time, and did
not die till after Horace. Proculeius was, like Maecenas, a favorcr of letters,
and is so referred to by Juvenal (S. vii. 94) : “ Quis tibi Maecenas quis nnnc
erit aut Proculeius ’Ξ ”

6. Notus—animi] Horace’s adaptation of Greek constructione is one of
the chief features of his style. He uses ‘ metuente ' here in the same sense as
in C. iv. 5. 20, “ culpari metuit Fides ”z ‘wings that refuse to melt,’ as
Icarius’s did. see c. iv. 2. 2. · ·

9. Latius rqqnes] The only king was the sage, according to the Stoice,
32? the sage kept all his passione under control. See S. i. 3. 125, n., and

ow, v. 21.

10. renwtis Gadibus] Gades (Cadiz) was taken poetically for the western
limit of the world, so that when Horace would say his friend Septimius was
willing to go with him to the ends of the earth, he sa s ‘ Septimi Gades
aditure mecum ’ (C. ii. 6. 1). It was originally, like Cart age, a Phoenician
seulement, of which there were many in Spain, whence Horace says ‘ uterque
PoenuS,' the Phoenicians in Africa and those in Hispania.

17. Phraaten] Phraates was restored to the Parthian throne B. c. 25

(C. i. 26, Introd.). It is called the throne of CyruS, because the Parthians · ἵ

succeeded to the greater part of the Eastern empire founded by Cyrus the

ODE 111.

Trm person to whom this Ode is nominally addressed is nerally snp-
posed to be Q. Dellius, who, from being a follower, first of olabella, and
then of Brutus and CassiuS, became a devoted adherent of M. AntoniuS, and
his tool, throughout his intri es· with Cleopatra, till shortly before the battle
of Actium, when he quarre led with Cleopatra and joined AugustuS, who

received him with favor (Plut. Anton. c. 59). Plutarch calls him ἱστορικός.
Dellius was called ‘ desultor bellorum civilium,' in allusion to the ‘ desultor '
of the circus, who rode two horses at the same time. Horace's way of giving
a name to his odes has been sufficiently noticed, and in this, as in other cases,
there is nothing to guide us to the person whose name hc uses. The Ode is
on his usual commonplaccS, - moderation, the enjoyment of the present
moment, and the certainty of death.

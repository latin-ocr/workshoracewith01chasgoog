how willingly he could resign them all, even as readily as Telemachus den
clined the horses of Menelaus (Odyss. iv. 601, sq.).

45. nucitum Tibur] ‘ Vacuum ' means ‘ idle.' WVhether Horace had a
house of his own at Tibur, or not, has been a gubject of much discussion3 it .
Is ᾖοωΡῗιῖῗίῗῖιιίὲῗ Ψῗῖιξὲθνῗέἒ &biamus Philippus, who was tribunus plebis
Β. o. 104, consul no. 81, and censor B. o. 76. He was a very distinguished
man, an energetic supportet of the popular cause, a friend of Cn. Pompeius,
and a powerful orator.

47. octavam circiter horam] The following is Martial's description of the ,

distribution of a Roman’s day :- The first and second hours were given to

the ‘ salutatio‚' or reception of client's and visitors. At· the third hour the

courts opened and business went on for three hours. The sixth hour was

given up to rest (aud the ‘ prandium'), the seventh to winding up buSIness, “
the eighth to exercise, and with the ninth began dinner. (Mart. iv. 8.) In

pli? main this appears to have been the division of the day in Horace’s time

1 ewise. ,

48. hm nimium distare Carinas] The Carinae was a collection of build-
ings on the north side of the Via Sacra, unde? Mons Esquilinus. It com-
prised the houses of many persons of distinction, among whom was Philippus,
The farthest part of the Carinae could not have been above three quarters of
a mile from the Forum Romanum ; but Philippus was old. Horace means

· to show that‘ he was inclined to bc peevish‚ being tired with his work 'ih the

Forum3 and in this splenetic humor, which, if this story be true, had become

habitual with him, he fell in with the man Mena, whose easy enjoyment of ·

life made a strong impression upon him. It made him jealouS, and he re-
solved to spoil his independencc if he could.

,- 50, Adrasum quendam] He had just been shaved, and was paring and.
cleaning his nails leisurely for himself (‘ proprios pu ntem ungues'); he .
did not emplo the barber for this operation, as peop e were in the -habit of
doing. The s op was empty, because those who would come for business
came early, and those who came to lounge came later (S. i, 7. 3). ‘ Umbra,' ·
which here means a shop‚ is used for different kinds of buildings by the poets,
as a ‘porticus' and a school. See Juvenal (vii. 173): “Ad pugnam qui
rthtorica descendit-ab umbra.'' The shops were open, probably, as they are
in tal now.

l 54. {mdc domo,] This phrase, which is equivalent to ‘a qua domo‚' occurs
in virgil (Aen. viii. 114) ε “ Qui genus<² unde domo ’.ἱ ” Phili us sends to
know who the man is, where he comes from, whether he is ric or poor ; if
‘ingenuus,' who is his father ; if a freedman, who -is his ‘ patronus!

l 55. Volteium nomine Menam] This person is 'epi-esentcd as a freedman
of some person of the Volteia gens, of which one or two are mentioned in the
Roman writers. A freedmau took the Gentile name of his master on his
manumission. The name Menas is akin to MenodoruS‚ as Demas to Deme-

. trias, Lucas to Lucanus, Silas to Sylvanus, Artemas to Artemius, etc.

¹ 56. sine crimine, notum Et] ‚The description Menas gives of himself is, that
he is a crier of small means, of unblemished character, well known as a pcr-
son who.could be active or quiet as the occasion required, and who cnjoyed
what he got3 one who made himself happy in the company of humble people, -.
in the possession of a house of his own, at the theatres and Circus, and with

'the amusements of the Campus Martius. ‘Et quaerere et uti,’ ‘to get and

to enjoy‚’ expresses the reverse of him who is ‘ nescius uti Compositis ’ (S. ii.
3. 109). .‘ Lare certo ' is opposed to a lodging, ‘ coenaculum ' (Epp. i. l. Q,
n.). It appears (v. 65) that he „transacted business as a seller; probably ‘ie
had some second-hand things of his own to dispose of. But the ‘ praeco ' w

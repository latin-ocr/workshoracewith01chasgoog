SATIRE vn:

Tim subject of this Satire is a disputo between Rupilius Rex, one of the
officers on the staff of Brutus, and a merchant named PersiuS‚ of Clazomenae
(a town on the gulf of Smyrna), arising, it 'may be supposed, out of some
money transactione. Horace treats the matter much in the same way as the
dispute got up between the two parasites for the amusement. of Maecenas and
-his friends at Caudium (S. 5. 51, sqq.). He no doubt had some reason for
disliking Rupilius, which the Scholiasts supply, whether with any sufficient
' authority it is impossible to say. They tell us that, this man's native place
was Praeneste (which ma be gethei-ed from v. 28), that he was banished
· from that town by his fe ow-citizens 3 that lie-then served in Africa in the

· proscribed by the TriumvirS‚ and joined the army of Brutus. Finally, that he
was disgusted at Horace, a man of low birth, being made a militar tribune,
, and continually insulted him, which indignities Horace retorted in t is Satire.

Persius, the Scholiasts say, was born of a Greek father and a Roman mother.
Beyond this, which may or may not be true, we know nothing about him but
what we guther-,from this Satire, that hc was a wealthy man, and carried on
a large business·of some kind at Clazomenae. The dispute arose when Bru-
tus and his army were in Asia Minor, which was in B. c. 43-44 (see note on
v. 18). How soon afterwards the Satire was written, it is impossible to say ;
not long, probably. It may have been made on the spot, and shown to those
-who would ,find most amusement in it, in the camp.

1. Proscripti Reya Rupili] The Rupilia gens was a plebeian family of no
great note in Rome. · The only one of the name who was distinguished was
P. Rupilius, consul in Β, c. 132, and the following year proconsul in Sicily.
He was the intimate friend of Laelius and the Youn-gcr Scipio (Cic. de Ami-
cit. 27). As to Rupilius Rex and Persius, see Introduction. By ‘ proscripti'
’ it is perha s intended to compare this Rex with the last of the Regae, Tar-

quinius. lif se, the play upon the name is repeated in the last liae. See
no} Hybrida quo pacto sit Persius aliua] ‘ Hybrida' applies to all cross-bred
⁶ animala, and was used for a man one of whose parents was a Roman and the
other a foreigner. · 5

3. Omnibus et lippis notum et tonsoribus] Tho apothecarics' and barbers'
shops were constantly crowded with idlcrs, who had nothing to do but to gos-
sipdabouttthe anSh ofR the houna eVlrfith thc lliarbffijs tigdhas'theeleasl? in aufaffis

the barber.

¹7. Confidens tumidusque‚] Sec C. iii. 4. 50, n.

8. Sisennae Barros ut equis] Of Sisenna and Barrus nothing is known;
but it may be conjectured, from this place, that their names were proverbial
for foul-mouthcd‚ abusive persons. The plural number is used here for the
singular, according to a usage common to all languageS. So Virg. Georg.
ii. 169 : “ Haec Decios, Marios, magnosque CamilloS‚ Scipiadas duros bello.'’
Cic. Cat. Maj. 6: “ Fabricii Curii Coruncanii.'’ See also above, C. i. 12.
37, where Scauros is probably put for the best of that family, M. AEmilius.
' ‘ Equis albis ' is equivalcnt to ‘sseet horses: according to that line of Virgil
' in which he describes the horses of Turnus, “ Qui candore nives anteirent,
ι cursibus auras ’³ (Aen. xii. 84). The expression ‘cquis pmcurreret albis ' is
proverbial, ‘ he would soon outstrip them.'

- ODE XXVII.

THE subject of this Ode appears to be a journey to Greece (v. 19), proposed
by a lady of Horacc's acquaintance, whom he pretends to deter from her pur·
pose‚· by reeiting the dangers she will have to encounter, and the fate that
waits upon female obstinat-y, as illustrated by the story of Europa, which
story occupies two thirds qs the Ode, and ‘puts aside Galatea and her journey.·

Attenuant. — Let the wieked go on their way with evil omens. I do but
pray for thee that the storm may be averted. Be happy, go where thou wilt,
and remember me, Galatea. Fear not those idle omens: but see the rising
storm: Ι know the dangers it portende». May they fall upon my enemy
rather than on thee. It was thus Europa lest her girlish task‚ and erossed the
sea by night, but feared not, till she stood on the shore of Crete. Then she
eried out in anguish: “'Alasl my father, a daughter-'s name I have aban-
doned; love is 'swallowed up in maduess, 'What an exchange is here!
Many deaths do 1 deserve to die. Am I awake, or is it a dream? Was it '
better to cross the sea than to gather young flowers at home? Ο that 1

fnight avenge myself on that monster, once too dcarly loved! Shame on me ·

that Ι left my home; shame that Ι delay to (lie. Let me go naked among
lions and perisli by figam, rather than waste away in a lingering death. ⁴ Vile
girl l ' my father eries, ‘ why dost thou not die 2- Here thou mayest‘hang by
thy girdle, or dash thee on the rockS, or into the stormy waves‚ unless thou
wouldst yield thyself a barbarian's slave! '' Tben came Venus and her son,
and laughed mischievously‚ and said: “ Cease th wrath, when the monster
shall come back to give thee thy revenge. What, nowest thou not that-thou

art the sponse of Jove ’ἒ Away with sighS. Bear thy noble destiny, for one
half the world shall take its name from thee.’' ’

3. Ram warrens] The meaning of ‘ ravus ' is not certain. Horace ap-
plies it to a wolf or a lion (Epod. xvi. 33), in the latter case imitating perhaps
Homer’s χαροποὶ λέοντες (odyss, xi. 611), for ‘ravus ' is said to be akin to

χαροπὸς. The wolf is represented as running down from the hills of Lanu-
vium, because that town was near the Appia Via leading to Brundisium,
where Galatea would embark.

’ 6. δι’ per obliquum] The image of the snake shooting, across the road re·
calls Jacob’s prophecy in respect to his son Dan: “ Dan shall be a serpent hy
the way; an adder in the path that biteth the horse’s heels, so that his ridcr
shall fall baekwards '' (Gen. xlix. U). '

like a far-seeing augur, before that bird (the erow) which tells of thc coming
storm shall go back to his stagnant pool‚ the eroaking raven with my prayers

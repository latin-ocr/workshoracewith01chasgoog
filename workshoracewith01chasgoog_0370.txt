ODE XXIX.

·T111s is an invitation from the poet to his patron, pressing him to pay ·
him a visit at his fanu. He bids him throw off the cares of the state, und
live for the enjoyment of the honr. The time is the dog-days. The year is

uncertain.

Aneumnxr.-—·Come, Maecenate, the wine and oil and the ssowers are*
ready. stay not for ever azing from a distance at the pleasant fields ef
Tibur, buried in the magni cence and the uproar, the wenlt and the smoke,
of the city. The rich man often likes to sup at the oor man’s table. The
days of drought are come back; the shepherd seeks t ie shade, the flock seeks·
the stream, not a breath is on the river-banks : but thou art distracting thy-
self with imaginat-y dangers. Heaven has wisely hidden the future from
man, and does but smile at his fears. Live for the present; all else is like
the stream, that now flows in nce, now is swollen to a stood, and sweeps
all with it to the sea. He lives appy who lives to-day, and leaves to-morrow
to Heaven, seeing that Jove himself cannot undo what is done.

As to Fortune, she is sickle, and changes from day to day. If she stays
with me, I am glad ; if she flieS, 1 am resigned. If the storm rageS, 1 have
no merchandise to sear for, and cau put out into any sea with safety in my

little burk.

t'o ‘moveri ' in “moveri digna bono dio'' (C. iii. 21. 6). The ‘balanus '

'5. Eripe ee mame,- «Μαι-ω’ is the dative.

6. Ne semper udum ‘ Udum ' is an epithet commonly applied to Tibur, '-
which stood on the banks of the Anio. The town itself was built on the side
of a hill (C. iii. 4. 23), but the fields below seem to have been (lamp (see C. i.
7. 14) from a number of small streams which watered them. It appears that
⁸ Maecenas was sighing for the country all the time ho was detained at Rome.

TelegonuS, son of Ulysses and Circe, was the re uted founder of Tusculum
and Praeneste. One of the legentis of the dent of Ulysses attributes it to ·
this son. AEsula was probably a town between Praencste and Tibur, but no
traces of its site remeia,- and Pliny says that it nolonger existed ·iu liis

- in the second. It does not occur in the fourth.

15. aulaeis et ostro} The meaning of ‘ aulaeis ' is explained in Sat. ii. 8.
54. It was usual to spread tapestry to catch any dust that might fall from
the ceiling. ‘ Aulaeis et ostro ’ may form · one subject, or ‘ ostro ’.may mean
the coverings of the couches. See S. ii. 3. 118, n.

16. Sollicitam explicuere frontem] This expression is repeated in Sat. ii. 2.
125: “ Explicuit vino contractae seriae frontis.” Tho perfect has the force ·
of the Greek aorist.

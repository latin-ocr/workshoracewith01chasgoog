ciariae ') by which the judices declared their votes, and Trebatius probably
means to say, that the votes of the judices will be decided by the amusement
of the scene, or else that the severity of their votes will be melted by it; that
ie, that the matter will be treated as unworthy of serious considentium the
judices will laugh at the joke, aad aequit the defendant.

SATIRE ΙΙ.. - ‘-

Tne object of this Satire is to teach the advantages of moderate eating.
of Ofella, the person into whose mouth Horace puts the chief part of his
precepts, we know no more than we may guther from the Satira itself, -·- that
in Horace's youth he ‚was the owner of an estate near Venusia, and that his

farm on that estate which 'was once his own. This transfer-took place, in auf
probability, when the troops returned to Italy after the battle of Philippi,
Β. 0.-42, at which time (among several other districts) the Venusinus ager
was distributed among the soldiers. It has been supposed that Horace visit- '
ed his native place, and renewed his acquaintance with Ofella, on his retum ·
'from Brundisium. (See Introduction to S. i. 5, sub fin.) The old man, un-
changed by the reverses of fortune, industrious and uneomplaining‚ exhorting
.his sons to frugality and contentment, is a pleasant picture, and helps b
” contrast to illustrate the gluttonous and luxurious habits of the city. ε

2. quae praecepit Ofello] See Introduction. .

’ 3. abnormis sapiens, crassaeque Mlier-vad A man wise without rule, and of
plain mother wit. Cicero (De Amicit. c. 5) uses the expression ‘⁴ agamus
pingui Minerva'' as a proverbial one. Minerva was the goddess of wisdom',
and ‘ crassa Minerva ' therefore meanS, proverbially, a coarse kind of wisdom.

4. inter lances mensasque nitentes] The wealthy Romans had already learned
to fill their-roonis with costly farnitum, and to make a display of their plate,
'whether in the shape of uscful or ornamental vessels. Vei-y much of the
plate thus displayed was of foreign manufacture, and very costly, and much

, of it was of great antiquity‚ and a good deal taken from Greek and Asiatic
templeS, and brought to Rome by various conquerors (Marcellus and Mum·
mins in particular), by extortionate governors'‚ or by the travelling ‘ merca-

· tores) who thus brought home the proceeds of the goods they took abroad.
The dishes of the rich were very generally of suver, so that the ‘lances ' here
mentioned would be, not only those which appeared for show, but those also
in which the viands were served. ‘ Lances ’ is here. used as a genet-ic name

; for dishes; but there were particular nameS, as ‘ patina,’ ‘ catinus‚’ ‘scutula‚'
‘ gabata,' ‘paropsis,’ all of different shapes and for different uses,

There appears to have been no article in which the Romans showed more
extravagance than their tables ; and Pliny relatcs of Cicero that he gave a
million sesterces for a table of the sort called ‘ orbes! These consisted of

, single slabs, sometimes of great diameter. . '

9. Corruptus judea] Horace likens the man whose judgment is biassed
1(ιέ a gne ῐεὸωὲθαῃᾱβοοᾱ dinner, to a judea who has been tampered with.

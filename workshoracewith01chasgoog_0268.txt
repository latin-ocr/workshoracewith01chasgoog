‘ Perpeti ' means to endure to the end. ‘ Vetit'um ’ with ‘ nefas ’ is not alto-
gether rcdundant. It expresses crimes which are obviously forbidden, as
shown by the obstruet-iens thrown in the way of their commission. ·

27. Iapeti yenus] ‘ Son of Iapetus ’ (Prometheus). This is after the use -
'of γένος, which occurs not rarely in the TragedianS. Eurip. (Cyclops 104)
has δριμὺ Σισύφου γένος, for Ulysses; and Virg. (Aen. iv. 12) “genus esse
Deorum? Compare S. ii. 5. 63.—Prometheus also claimed 'to be the in·
ventor of ships (Aesch. P. ,V. 467). -

·· 28. fraude mala] ‘ Mala ’ means mischievous or fatal theft, referring to

o that ‘ prius ' also affecta ‘ tarda' The story of the diseases and ills which

36. Herculeas lab] So Odyss. xi. 600, βιή Ἡρακληείη for Herculcs.·
“Catonis virtus ²? (C. iii. 21. ll), “'virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia Laeli ''

Hades, for the purpose of bringing up Cet-benis, was the twelfth labor im·
posed on him by Eurystheus. '

soDE IV.

L. Saevus, whose name is used in this Ode, was one of those who set-ved
with Horace under. Brutus, a'nd they were no doubt on oerms of intimacy.
The Ode professes to be written at the beginning of spring, and its subject·
is the uncertainty of life and the duty of enjoying it.

. ARGUMENT.- The winter is thawing ; the spring is mturningg the ships
agre being launched ; the herds quit their stalis and the ploughman his fire- ·
side ; and the meadows are no longer white with frost. Venus and the
Graees are leading the danes, and the Cyclops’ forge is burning. Let us bind
the head with myrtle or the earth’s first flowerS‚ and sacrifice a lamb or kid'
to Pan. Death calls on rich· and poor alike. Life is short, Ο Sestius! and
our bo es we must conti-act. The grave awaits thee3 and when there, no
more-‘slim thou preside at the feast, or sigh for the fait young Lycidas.

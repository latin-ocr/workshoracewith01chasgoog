next verse, see C. iii. 21. 6, n:, and Epp. i. 3. 35, n.

money out of her master, Simo. As to ‘ emunet0‚’ see S. i. 4. 8, n.

239. Silenus] This god is said to have educated Bacchus. He represented
the ‘crassa Minerva' of the ancients‚ ‘ wisdom under a rough exterior‚’ and
it is in his graver character that Horace here views him. All ancient repre-

· sentations of Silenus exhibit him as a gross impersonation of sensuality and

low fun, usually drunk, and riding upon an ass, with Fauus dancing about
him. Modern ideas have confoundcd him with BacchuS, his foster-child.

240. Ex noto fictum carmen sequar-,J ‘ Ex noto’ perhaps means that the
subject must be familiar. · ·

244. Fauni,] See C. ii. 19. 4, n. Horace sa s that these rough bcings
introduced from the woods should not talk as i thev had been born in the
city and were loungers in the Forum, or languish in' love-verses like a silly
youth 3. but neither should low lang-uage be put into their mouth, for this 1s
sure to offend the refined part of the audienee, even if the vulgar applaud it.
‘ Juvenor’ is a word not found elsewhere-z it is adapted from the Greek

νεανιεύεσθαι.

248. et pater] ‘ These who had a father ' means ‘ ingenui‚’ those who
were born free and of lawful wedlock, since none others were ⁴ in patria po-
testate' As to ‘ciecr,’ see S. i. 6. 115, n.

251. Syllaba Ionya brevi] As to th'e ‘ iambus) see above, v. 79, sq. Horace
here calls it ‘pes citu& a ra id foot, as elsewhere (C. i. 16. 24) he speaks of
‘ celeres iambos? He says t e rapidity of the foot caused the division of the
verse into the form of a trimeter, whereas it was a ‘senariuS‚' having six
distinct iambie fect. The admission 'of a spondeo in the' odd feet, he says,
was an after invention, in order to give more weight to the measure. ‘ Non
ita pridem ' means comparatively latcly ; but the verses of Archilochus had
spondees in them. The history is not very accurate. Horace has himself
imitated the pure iambic measure in the alternate verses of Epod. 16. ‘ In
jura paterna recepit' is to be rendered ‘gave a share of its patrimony.’ The
meaning is clear enough from the context. The politeness of the ‘iambus '
in making way for the spondee, and giving up some of its just rights, but not
disposed to be so accommodating as to give up the even places in the verse,
siecmshrather a heavy joke. ‘ Socialitcr‚’ ‘ in a friendly way,' does not occur
e sew ere.

258. Hic ἅ in Acci] See Epp. ii.- l. 50. 56. The iambus, Horace says, is
not commonly used in the verses of Accius and Ennius. Those of the for-
mer he calls noble trimeters, by which, he means iamed. He was no great
admirer of thern himself. The great weight he attributes to the verses of
Ennius arose from the gravity of the measure, consisting, as v. 260 does,
chiefly of spondees. But the absence of the iambus, in the opinion of Horace,
vconvicts him either of slovcnly writing, or of ignorance of his art. ‘ Hie'

. governs ‘premit’ (v. 262), as it does ⁴ apparet.’ ⁴ This: that is, ‘the ab-

teneo of this!

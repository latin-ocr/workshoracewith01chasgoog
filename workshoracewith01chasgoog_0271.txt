ODE VI.

Tms Ode is addressed to M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the friend and general,
and at a later time the son-in-law, of Augustus, It was probably written

after the battle of Actium, where Agrippa. commanded the fleet of Augustus
against M. Antonius, He may have asked Horace„ to write an ode in his
honor, and he declines in a modest way, professing to be unequal to such
high exploits, which he places ou the same level with those of Homer’s

heroes. ο

Anemurium—Varius shall sing in Homerie strain of th victories by
sea and land. My humble muse does not sing of these, o the wrath of
Achilles„ or the wandel-iuga of Ulysses, or the fate of Pelops's house, nor will
she disparage thy glories and Caesar’s. Who ean fitly sing of Mars, mail-‘
elad,—of Meriones, blaek with the dust of Troy, -— of Diomed, a match
for gods ‘3 1 sing but of feasts, and of the battles of boys aud girls·

1. Scn'ben's] See next Ode, v. 1, n. L. Varius Rufus was a distin uished
epic and tragic poet frequently mentioned by Horace, with whom e was
intimate, and whom he introduced to Maecenas. He was popular with his‘
pontqmplqrarigzffi assd mue? {ignit-ed by them. Augustus also had au affec-
ion or im see . u. . . ·

2. wrmiru's ale'te,]pp‘ Alite ' is >iu apposition with ‘ Vario! Translate, ‘bird
of Homeric song-³ In prose the ablative of the agent without a preposition'
is not admissible. But Horace has the same construction, C. iii. 5. 24. S ii.
1. 84. Epp. i. 1. 94. It is most frequently found in Ovid. Homer is called
‘ Maeonius ⁹ from the fact that Smyrna, a. town of Lydia, more anciently
called Maeonia, was one of those that claimed to be his birthplaee.

3. Quam rem cunque] The construction is by attraction. The full expres-
sion would be ‘scriberis et scribetur omnis res quamcunque.' Agrippa's
great successes up to this time had been in the Perusian war against L.
AntoniuS‚ nc. 41 (in 'which he had the principal command under Augus-
Ἇιε), in (gaal aud Germany, by land 3 and against Sex. Pompeius and at

etium sea.

4. te ι’ἰαεζ] See next Ode, ν. 27, n.

5. neque llaec — nec yravevn] This is as if he had said t ‘ Ι should not think

of singing of these victories, any more thau I should of the wrath of Achilles?
Compare C. iii. 5. 27 - 30: '
“ Neque amissos colores
Lana refert medicata fuco,
Nec vera virtus eum semel excidit ,

Curat reponi deterioribus.'’
‘ As the staiued wool does not recover its lost color, so true virtue once lost

will not be restored to the degener-ate! ⁸ Gravcm stomachum ’ is a transla-
. tion of μῆνιν οὐλομένην (n. i. 1), and ‘ cedere nescii ' is explained by ‘ inexo-
rabilis,' A. P. 121. This construction with ‘ nescius' is not uncommon.
Virgil, Aen. xii. 527: “Rumpuntur nescia vinci pectora-’³ ovid, Ep. ex
Pont. ii. 9. 45 : “ Marte ferox et vinei nescius armiS.”

SATIRE VIII.

This Satire represents a dinner given by a rich vulgar man to Maecenas and
five of his friends. There is not. so much to distinguish it in the way of hu·-
mor as the subject admitted of. Few subjeets present more scope for face-
tious satire than the airs of low-born men, lately become rich, aping the ways
of the fashionable world, and making wea'lth their one passport into what is
called good society. This isa very slight sketch‚ and some of the force even
os this is perhaps lost through our ignoranee of little points of etiquctte and
culinary refinemeiits observed by the Romans of ‘that day.

The host's name is Nasidienus Rufus. Who he waS‚ it is impossible to
sav. · ' . ’

‘Instead of telling the story himself, though it is probable from the tone of
the Satire that he writes from a scene he had witnessed, Horace puts it into
the mouth of his friend FundaninS, the eomic writer mentioned 'in S. i. 10.

. 1. Nasidieni] Sec Introduction. The third and fourth svllables coalesco.

· ‘Beati ³ means wealthy and favored of fortune. See C.·i. 4: 14, n.

2. here] ‘Heri 'is a dative form, ‘here' an ablative3 so we have ‘mani'
and ‘mane’ in the morning, ‘vesperi’ and ‘vespere’ in the evcning. The
termination in ‘i ' is the older of the two, and it would seem as if the usage
- of the word was in a state of transition at this time. ⁸

3. De medio potare dia] Nasidienus dined early, to make the most ‚os his
feast. Δ But ‘medio die’ need not be taken quite literally. The ‘ pmnd1um³²
was usually taken at noon. The dinncr-hour was later. (See C. 1. l. 20, n.)
Bus men, as we saw in S. 7. 33, sat down by candle-light. ⁶ De m'edio dle '
is li e ‘de noete' in Epp i. 2. 32, ‘media de luce‚’ Epp. i. 14. 34.· ‘De’
means ‘after‚’ that is, ‘de medio die' means ‘after midday'3 but it must·
note proximitv to midday, or it would have no meaning at all.

4. faerit melina] See S. 6.. 4, n. ⁶1 never was better off in my life! He
says this ironieally, or with reference to the amusement he had got from the
vulgarity of Nasidienus.

Da, st yrave non est,] There is a like use of ‘dare ' in virgil (Eoi. i. 19),
“ sed tamen iste Deus qui sit da. Tityre, nobis.'' Terence also uses it:
“Nunc quam ob rem has partes didicerim paucis dabo” (Heaut. Prol. 10).
From the meaning of this word, ‘to put,' this application of it is easily de-

ve .

n 5.d iratum ventrem placaverit] Compare S. 2. 18: ‘⁶ Lati-antem stomachum.”
Both passages put together suggest the idea of ‘a sop tlirown to an angry do
'to keep him quiet. Perhaps that notion‚ or something of the sort, suggestefi

‘ promulsis' (S. i. 3. 6, n.)‚ and the things of which it was usually in a great .

measure composed wene sent up in the same dish with the'boar‚ which was
generally served whole, and was the chief dish, ‘caput coenae? TurnipS„
lettuees, radishes, parsnips, with piekles and sauces of various descriptione
(see S. 4. 73, n.)‚ generally formed part of the ‘gustus'· or ‘promulsis'
which preceded the ‘fercula,' or courses of which the regular ‘coena ' con-
sisted. The boar was killed, the host (called ‘coenae pater’ with a sort of
moek respect) informed his gaesus, when the south wind was not at its worst. ‘¹

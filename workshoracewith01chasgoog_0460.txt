‘Romans walked in cold weather .ιο get the sun, and had a full view ,οἰ the

Priapus says the locality is now made healthy, and the citizens may take
their walk without being sickened with the sight of bones bleachin upon th&
plain, whereas his vexations still remain, — tue driving away 0f t ieves and
wild animala, which still frequented the spot, and, yet worse, the punishment
and scaring away of the witcheS, who·there continued to carry on their abom-

before the tombs were cleared awa (ν. 36), in which the characters intro-

‘succinctam ’ significs ‘ expeditam,’ ‘ swift in her movcments,' as in Epod. v.

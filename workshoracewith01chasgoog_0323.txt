ODE XV.

Wmm Augustus had brought the civil wars to an end, B. o. 29, he applied
himself to the reformation of munnere, and Horace probably wrote this and
other Odes (ii. 18, iii 1 -6) to. promote the reforms of Augustus ; perhaps

‚ by his desire, or that of Maecenas. They should be read together, and with
C. i. 2. From the reference to the temples in the last stanza, it mav be‘
assumed perhaps that this Ode and the sixth of, the third book were written
about the same time, that ie, B. c. 28, when Augustus set himself particu-
lari to restore the public buildingS, which had fallen into neglect during the
clvi wars.

Augustus passed ³,several sumptum-y laws to keep down the expensive
habits of the rich citizensi, re ulatin in particular the ,eost of festivals and .
banquets). But they soon fefi into gisuse and contempt, as TiberiuS, writing .
to the Senate fifty years afterwards, declared: ‘¹ Tot amajoribus refertae

· legeS, tot quas dirus⁴ Augustus tulit„ illae oblivione, hae, quod flagitiosius
est, contemptu abolitae securiorem luxum fecere‚” (Tac. Ann. iii. 54).
Horace in this Ode complains that the rich are wasting their means on fine
houses and luxurious living, contrary to the example of their forefathers,
who were content to live in huts while they built haudsome temples sor

,the gode.

1. Jam pauca aratro] Tiberius (see Introduction) complained to the Sen-
ate that Rome was entirely dependent on the provinces for her corn, and was
at the mercy of the winds and wwes, which might at any time cut off the
supply and reduce the citizens. to live on their ornamental woods and country-
houses. (Compare Sall. Bell. Cat. 13.) · ‘Regiae ' is used in the same way ,

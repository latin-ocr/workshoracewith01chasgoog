We may infer from the present poem, that Horace wished to clear himself

from the imputation of a censorious spirit, and so to set himself right with
Maeeenas and his friends. The connection between the two Satires is seen in
the opening of this, in which Tigellius is again introduced, aud the peculiar-
ities of his character described, for no other reason, as it would seem, than to
serve as a· text sor the discourse that follem, on the dut-y of judging others
chatitably‚ ss we wish to be judged onrselves. In the course of his remarks
on this subject, Horace falls upon two of the Stoic abfflndities; one, that all
stulte are alike (v. 96, sqq.), which he meets b the Epicurean absurdity that
expediency is the foundation of right; and t η other, >that every wisc· man
(that is, every Stoic) is endowed with all the gifts of art and fortune, from the
eskill'of tlhe meclmnie to {he power of a king. With a jest upon this folly the

6. ab ovo Usque ad meda] The ‘promulsis,’ otherwise ‘called ‘ gustus,’

There were convivial songs among the Greeks to which they gave the 'name

be pronounced as the singer might be supposed to pronounce it.

‘ now,' or some time not far from the present. It is the ablative of ἱ modus,’
‘measure,' and ‘modo’ is ‘within measure,’ and therefore its sense is con-
fined to limited quantities. Compare the use of ‘modo’ and ‘ admodum ’
in Terence (Hec. iii. 5. 8): “Advenis- modo? Pam. Admodum.’' ‘Are Ἰ
